            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for they ſhall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THeſe words are the words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
unto rebellious <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> having ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them
in the former verſes, the trouble and confuſion which comes by ſin; it is
the cauſe of the loſs of Temporal and Spirituall Enjoyments, thence
ariſeth diſobedience to Parents, as you may read in the 5, and 6, verſes;
he comes in theſe two verſes read to you; to ſhew that though it be a day
of publique Calamity, when the ſhews of mens countenances do witneſs
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and ſhews their ſin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> yet <pb facs="tcp:151210:4"/>
then is there good news from heaven for the righteous ſoul, here is glad
tydings of peace and ſafety for him, <hi>It ſhall be well with him:</hi>
here is all good things comprehended in this word, <hi>Well:</hi> it ſhall go
well with him here, well with him hereafter: this ſhall be his comfort, this
his joy: <hi>He ſhall eat the fruit of his doings,</hi> and be ſatisfied.
But what ſhall become of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked? ſhall it be ſo with them? read the
next verſe, behold their doom, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it if poſſible: <hi>Woe to the
wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, for the reward of his hands ſhall be
given him.</hi> Better for him he had never bin born, for eternal miſery is
his portion, he hath done ill, and the fruits of his evil déeds ſhall
he receive: not a word of mercy to him, not a word of comfort for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
hath had his good things in this life: and the Children of God their evil
things: but now they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and he is formented, they have the good
ſpirit, the holy Ghoſt to comfort them, but the wicked man the evil
ſpirit to torment him: in a word all the woes and denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of wrath
ſhall be executed againſt him, which are written in the Book of God.</p>
                  <p>The obſervation that I would note from theſe words, is
this,</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:151210:5"/>Doct. <hi>That in the midſt of miſery, the

ſick of love? The blood of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt was not ſhed in vain,
but he dyed, that his might live, he went through ſorrows, that his might
have joy, he was Crowned with Thorns, that his might be Crowned with glory.
They are thoſe whom he hath called out of darkneſs into this marvellous
light; for theſe he hath procured a ſalvation, &amp; an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting

loſe thoſe whom he hath choſen, and whom the Father hath given him;
<hi>but the light of his countenance ſhall ſhine upon them, and he will

ſinner left in? how can you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> read or hear, once think without trembling,
of the condition that ſuch forlorn wretches will be in, when they look about
them, and ſée God that hath forſaken them, becauſe they forſook
him firſt; and when they look about them, and ſée the Saints on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
one hand, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, now ſentenced unto glory, &amp; the wicked
on the other hand, whom they accompanied and imitated, now judged with them to
ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting miſery: When they look below them, and ſée the flames
that they muſt abide in, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for evermore, and when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Devil begins to
hale them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> execution: Oh poor ſouls! now what would they give for a
Chriſt, for a promiſe, for a time of repentance, for a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of mercy,
which once they ſlept under, or made no account of: How is the caſe altred
now with them? Who would think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe are the ſame men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made light
of all this on earth; that ſo ſtoutly ſcorned the reproofs of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Word,
that would be worldly, and fleſhly, &amp; drunk, and proud; let Preachers
ſay what they would, and perhaps hated them that did give them warning: now
they are of another <pb facs="tcp:151210:11"/> mind, but all too late: now would they draw
back, and lay hold of any thing, rather then be dragged away into thoſe
flames: but there is no reſiſting: Satans temptations might have
béen reſiſted, but his exacutions cannot: Gods judgments might have
béen prevented by faith &amp; prayer, &amp; a holy life, but they
can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reſiſted when they are not prevented: glad would the miſerable
ſinner be, if that he might but turn to nothing, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might be any thing
rather then a reaſonable creature: but their wiſhes are all in vain, there
is but one time, and one way for a ſinners delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: if he fail in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

They would none of my counſels, they deſpiſed all my reproofs, therefore

devices, for the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the

ſhall dwell ſafely, and ſhall be quiet for fear of evil.</hi> This God

the juſt law that hath been contemned, and thoſe righteous ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes that

                  <p>As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Our God is a conſuming

Contrition.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Meditate on the coſt and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
ſin: conſider, O ſtubborn ſinner! what will ſin coſt you? Namely,
thoſe endleſs torments that cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd: hath not the God of
Heaven and Earth, with all his attributes, paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you; to wit, his

and ſaid, bounty hath kept you, patience hath born with you, long-ſuffering

great unto you: all theſe will bid you adiew, and ſay, Farewel damned Soul,
you muſt pack hence to Hell: to have fellowſhip with damned Ghoſts, where
you ſhall have everlaſting pain, without one jot of pleaſure: continual
ſorrow, without one drop of joy.</p>
                  <p>Conceive in thy ſoul, the juſt God cannot but juſtly be
angry with you, and he will not let Sin go unpuniſhed: and let the
conſideration of this fetch tears from thy eyes, and ſorrow from thy heart.
Meditation upon theſe things, if ſolid and ſerious, muſt needs cauſe
a heart-breaking for ſin: but to give you ſome Reaſons, why there muſt
be this piercing and wounding of Soul for Sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Becauſe Sin is the greateſt
evil of the Soul, and the greateſt burden alſo: that is moſt grievous,
which is moſt heavy: now as there is no evil, ſo properly and directly evil
to the ſoul, as the evil of Sin: ſo there is nothing that 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151210:19"/> can properly do good to the Soul, but God: Now while a
ſinner comes to ſee his ſin, he cannot ſorrow for his Sin: now it is
godly ſorrow cauſeth Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto life, as you may ſee in the 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. And aſſuredly, the ſoul that ſees not the evil of
ſin, ſhall fall by the evil of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> Why unfeigned ſorrow and
contrition of heart for ſin, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation: becauſe by
ſound ſorrow, the Soul is truly prepared and fitted for the Lord Jeſus
Chriſt; as you may ſee in the 9. of the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> and the
3. verſe, <hi>Plow up the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ground of your hearts, and ſow not among
thorns.</hi> What is it elſe, but to have the heart pierced with the terrors
of the Lord, by a ſound, ſaving ſorrow for ſin? Plow up the
corruptions, which are the Thorns and Thiſtles in your hearts, as the Prophet
<hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.27. <hi>It's a broken and a
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe:</hi> the heart muſt be
broken all to pieces, even to powder, and muſt be content to be weaned from
all ſin, which is the way to be fitted for Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151210:20"/>3. <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The ſoul
cannot part with his Sins and Luſts, which are his God, until he find
himſelf wearied with them, and as gall and worm-wood to him, and now this
weariedneſs and burthen of Sin, muſt needs cauſe in the ſoul, a ſound
ſorrow for it, before the ſoul ſees the venemous and ugly nature of it,
he is not willing to part with it: go to pull away the Adulterers Whores; and
the Drunkards Pots, you had as good go kill them: the reaſon is, becauſe
they find ſweetneſs in thoſe baſe courſes, and they are all their
delight: but now when the Lord comes to lay a heavy weight upon this man's
ſhoulder, thoſe Sins which were ſo ſweet before, he finds them now as
bitter as gall and worm-wood, and now he lies down in ſorrow, and crys out:
Oh! is Sin ſuch a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly killing evil, as it will certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy body
and ſoul in Hell? and is there no entring into Heaven with the guilt of
theſe upon my ſoul? Good Lord, do what thou wilt with me, only take my
ſoul and ſave me, and take away my luſts and corruptions from me.</p>
                  <p>Thus have you briefly the reaſons of <pb n="9" facs="tcp:151210:20"/> the
Point, that this is the way of Gods working: That ſorrow and Contrition of

Oxen? and oh! wilt not thou help to eaſe the heart of thy Brother, that is

21,22,23. <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that my ſorrows were all weighed, they
would prove hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than the ſands.</hi> As if he had ſaid, Oh my friends
have pity upon me: What, have you no regard of a man in miſery? have you no
pity, though he cry in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of ſoul, help, help, for the Lords
ſake: Oh pray for, and pity thoſe wounds and vexations of ſpirit, which
no man feels but he that is thus wounded: the poor man lies crying under the
burden of Sin, ſighing and mourning, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Oh when will it once be,
that God will receive his drooping Soul: certainly it would make ones heart 
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:151210:21" rendition="simple:additions"/> bleed to hear the ſwoundings away of ſuch a

breathing out his ſorrow, as though he was going down to Hell: It is a ſign
that ſoul is marked out for deſtruction himſelf, who harboureth ſuch a

can you endure to ſee them pricked to the heart? roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtaring under

thoſe things for which they have cauſe to be aſhamed: Says the vile

which is, as I may ſay, the Queen of ſins, the root of all evil, the rot of
all good, a ſin which turns a man wholly into ſin, that it were far better,
to be a Toad, or a Serpent, then a drunkard; for the drunkard is like
<hi>Ahab,</hi> who ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs: he wholy dedicates,
reſigns, ſurrenders himſelf to ſerve ſin and Satan: his only

Frogs in a puddle, or Water-ſhakes in a pend, for their whole exerciſe,

ſaid to have ſlain in the very inſtant of his Adoltry, and carry him
quick to Hell: ſome Drunkards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly ſtrook with Death, as if
the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution were no leſs intended to the Soul, then to the Body: And no
wonder, for Drunkards are indéed the Devils Captains, at his comand, and
ready to do his will, he rules over, and works in them his pleaſure, 2

duls, and dams up the head and ſpirits with mud, but it beſtiates the
heart, and being worſe then the ſting of an Aſpe, poyſoneth the very
Soul and Reaſon of a man: whereby the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and organs of reſolution
and Repentance, are ſo corrupted, and captivated, that it makes men utterly
uncapable of returning, unleſs God ſhould work a greater miracle upon them,
then was the Creating of the whole world. Theſe agents for the Devil
[Drunkards] practice nothing but the Art of Debauching <pb n="6" facs="tcp:151210:31"/> men,
for to turn others into beaſts: They will make themſelves Devils, wherein
they have a notable dexterity; as 'tis wonderful to ſee how they will wind
men in, and draw men on, by drinking: firſt, a health to ſuch a man, then
to ſuch a woman my Miſtreſs, then to every one's Miſtreſs; then to
ſuch a Lord or Lady, their Maſter, their Captain, Comander, &amp;c. And
never ceaſe till their Brains, their Wits, their Tongues, their Eyes, their
Féet, their Sences, and all their Members fail them: They will drink
till they vomit up their ſhame again, like a filthy Dog, or lye wallowing in
their beaſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, like a bruitiſh Swine: they thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>k nothing too much to do, or ſpend, that they may make
a Sober man a Drunkard, or make a Religious man excéed his bounds, at
which they will, and rejoyce, as at the deviſion of a ſpoil: But what a
Barbarous, Graceleſs, and Antichriſtian-like practice is this, to make it
their glory paſtime, and delight, to ſée God diſhonoured, his
Spirit grieved, his Name blaſpheamed, his Creatures abuſed, themſelves
and their friends Souls damned: yet ſuch is their wickedneſs, and ſo
pernicious are they, that to damn their own Souls is the leaſt part of their
miſchief, for they draw vengeance upon thouſands, by ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome,
and giving ill examples to others: ſo that one Drunkard makes a multitude,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="7" facs="tcp:151210:31"/> like the Bramble, <hi>Jude</hi> 9.15. which firſt
ſet it ſelf on fire, and then fired all the wood; or like a malicious man
ſick of the Plague, that runs into the throng, to diſperſe his Infection.
And this ſhews that they not only partake of the Devils nature, but they are
very Devils in the likeneſs of men, and that the very wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one
that feareth God, is far better then the good intreaty of a Drunkard: yet the
Drunkard is ſo pleaſing a Murtherer, that he tickles a man to death, and
makes him like <hi>Solomons</hi> Fool, dye laughing: whence it is that many,
who hate their other enemies, yea, and their friends too, imbrace this enemy,
becauſe he kiſſeth when he betrayeth: Hence it is alſo, that
thouſands have confeſt at the Gallows, I had never come to this, but for
ſuch a Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; for commonly the Drunkards Progreſs, is, from Luxury, to
Beggery, from Beggery, to Thievery, from the Tavern to Tiborn, and from the
Ale-houſe, to the Gallows. Thus theſe bawds &amp; panders of Vice, breath
nothing but infection and ſtudy nothing but their own and other mens
deſtruction. The Drunkard is like <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, who never
did a man a courteſie, but it was to damn his Soul: but little do they think
how they advance their own damnation, when the blood of ſo many Souls as they
have drawn away, will be required at <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151210:32"/> their hands; for let
theſe Tempters know that they do not more encreaſe mens wickedneſs on
earth, (whether by perſwaſion, or provocation, or example) then their
aſſociates wickedneſs ſhall increaſe their damnation in Hell,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16.27,28.</p>
                  <p>Now it were endleſs to repeat the vain bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
ſcurrilous jeſting, wicked talking, impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſweating and curſing of
the drunken crew when they are got together in a Tipling houſe, where they
ſit all day in troops, doing that in earneſt, which we have ſeen boys do
in ſport, ſtand on their heads, and ſhake their heels againſt heaven:
where, even to hear how the Fame of the Lord Ieſus is pierced, and how Gods
Fame blaſpheamed, would make a ſober man to tremble. A Drunkards tongue is
like the ſayl of a Wind-mill; for as a great gale of wind whirleth the
ſayls about, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of drink whirleth his tongue about, and
kéeps it in continual motion: now he rails, now he ſcoffs, now he lies
now he ſlanders, now he ſeduces, talks bawdy ſwears, bans, foams, and
cannot be quiet till his tongue be wormed: ſo that from the begining to the
end he beleheth forth nothing but what is as far from Truth, Piet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

man would think that even the Devil himſelf ſhould bluſh to hear his
child ſo taſk: yea, did any ſober man but hear, and ſée, and
ſmell, and know what is done in theſe Taverns and Ale-houſes, you would
wonder that the earth could bear the houſes, or the Sun endure to look upon
them. The Land doth every where abound with theſe Caterpillars, ſo that in
Country and City thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands may be found, who do in ſhear drink, ſpend
all the cloaths on their beds and backs, they drink the very blood of their
Wives and Children, who are néer famiſhed, to ſatiſfie the

<hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. Much more might be ſpoken againſt the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and

Grave, the deeper you dig, the fuller you ſhall find him, both of ſtench
and horrour; or like <hi>Hercules</hi>'s Monſter, wherein were freſh heads,
ſtill ariſing one after the cutting off another. But there needs no more
then this laſt, to make any wiſe man, or any that love their own ſouls to
deteſt, and beware theſe Bawds and Pandors of Vice, that breath nothing but
infection, and ſtudy nothing but their own and other mens deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have unmasked their faces, that <pb n="10" facs="tcp:151210:33"/>
they may appear odious to themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and I have declaimed

makes us Vice deteſt. Oh that I had dehortation anſwerable to my
deteſtation of it: And, Oh that every drunkard would take warning hereby and
be perſwaded, if not for Gods ſake, yet for their ſouls and bodies
ſake, to leave their immoderate drinking, and to live godly, righteouſly,

whoſe oaths, the Land mourns, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.10. For indeed Swearing is a
ſin that hath ſo much over-ſpread the whole Nation, that it is almoſt
grown as cuſtomary a thing, both to young and old, to ſwear, as to ſpeak;
yet of all other ſins, this ſin of ſwearing is moſt inexcuſable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is a Sin, from which of all other Sins,
we have moſt power of abſtinence: for if men were forced to pay ten groats
for every oath they ſwear, as the Law enjoyneth: or if they were ſure to
have their tongues cut out, which is too light a puniſhment for this Sin,
damnation being the due penalty thereof as the <pb n="11" facs="tcp:151210:33"/> Apoſtle
ſets it down, <hi>James</hi> 5.12. they both could, and would leave it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is a Sin, to which, of all other ſins,
we have the leaſt temptation, for all that men can expect by it, is the
ſuſpition of being common Lyers, by being common Swearers: It brings not
ſo much as any apearance of good, to induce us: For whereas other Sins have
their ſeveral baits to allure us, ſome the bait of profit, ſome of
honour, ſome of pleaſure, this ſin is deſtitute of them all, and only
brings much loſs here: namely, of Credit, and a good Conſcience, and the
loſs of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and the Kingdom of Heaven here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; which is of more
value then ten thouſand Worlds: which ſhews that men love this Sin, only,
becauſe it is a great Sin, and Swear, out of meer malice to, and contempt of
God; which is moſt fearful, and (as a man would think) ſhould make it
unpardonable: I am ſure the Pſalmiſt hath a terrible word for all ſuch,
if they would take notice of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.3. Let them be confounded

may deem, or dream it to be but a mite, a mote, a matter of nothing, yet ſuch
as have the leaſt knowledge of the Law of God, or skill in Scripture, well
know that God expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids it, and that upon pain of Damnation,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 12.5. and that Chriſt commands us not to ſwear at all, in our
ordinary Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaying: that <hi>whatſoever is more then yea, yea,
or nay, nay, cometh of evil, Mat.</hi> 5.34,35. If the matter be light and
vain, we muſt not ſwear at all: if ſo weighty, that we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſwear, as before a Magiſtrate, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it, then we muſt only
uſe the glorious name of our God, in a holy &amp; religious manner; as you

<hi>Joſh.</hi> 23.7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.13. And the reaſons thereof are
weighty, if we look into them: for in ſwearing, by Faith, our Lady, the
Light, or any other Creature, you aſcribe that unto the ſaid Creature,
which is only proper to God: namely, to know your heart, and to be a
diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſecret things: Why elſe ſhould you call the Creature as a
witneſs unto your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that you ſpeak the truth, and lye not?
which only belongeth to God. And therefore the Lord calls it a forſaking of
him: As mark well what he ſaith, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>How ſhall I ſpare
thee, for theſe thy Children have forſaken me, and <pb n="14" facs="tcp:151210:35"/>
ſworn by them that are no Gods.</hi> And do you make it a ſmall matter to
forſake God, and make a God of the Creature. Will you believe the Prophet
<hi>Amos,</hi> who ſpeaking of them that ſwore by the Sin of
<hi>Samaria,</hi> ſaith that <hi>they ſhall fall and never riſe again,
Amos</hi> 8.14. A terible place to vain ſwearers: Yea in ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by any
Creature, we do invocate the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and aſcribe to it divine Worſhip, a
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful oath being a kind of invocation, and a part of Gods Worſhip: Yea,
whatſoever we ſwear by, that we invocate, both as our Witneſs, Surety,

and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating unto it Gods incomunicable Atributes, as his Omnipreſence,
and Omniſciency, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every where preſent, and knowing the ſecrets,

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, in patronizing, protecting, defending, and rewarding us for
ſpeaking the truth, or puniſhing us if we ſpeak falſly: all which are
ſo peculiar to God, as that they can no way be comunicated, or aſcribed to
another: ſo that in ſwearing by an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Idolatry, thou ſpoyleſt, and robeſt God of his Glory, (the moſt impious
kind of theft) and in a manner dethroneſt him, and placeſt an Idol in his
room: neither are <pb n="15" facs="tcp:151210:35"/> we to joyn any other with God in our
oaths, for in ſo doing, we make baſe Idols, and filthy Creatures corrivals
in honour, and competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours in the throne of Iuſtice, with the Lord, who is
Creator of heaven and earth, and the Iudge, and ſole Monarch of the World:
Or, in caſe we do, our doom ſhall be reamidileſs: for the Lord threatneth
by the Prophet <hi>Zepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> that he will cut off them that ſwear by the
Lord, and by <hi>Malcham,</hi> which <hi>Malcham</hi> was their King, or as
ſome think, their Idol, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.4,5. But as if ſwearing alone
would not preſs men deep enough into Hell, they add curſing to it, a ſin
of an higher Nature, which none uſe frequently, but ſuch as are
deſperately wicked, it being their peculiar brand in Scripture: as how doth
the Holy Ghoſt Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize ſuch a one: <hi>His mouth is full of curſing,
Pſal.</hi> 10.7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.14. or, <hi>he loveth curſing,

to have their mouths full of curſing, but Ruffians, and ſons of
<hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi> ſuch as have ſhaken out of their hearts the fear of God,
the ſhame of men, the love of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the dread of Hell not once caring what
is thought or ſpoken of them here, or what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of them hereafter: yea,
obſerve them well, and you will find that they are mockers of all that march
not under the pay of the Devil: <pb n="16" facs="tcp:151210:36"/> beſides, it is the very
depth of ſin: roaring and drinking is the horſe-way to hell, whoring and
cheating the foot-way, but ſwearing and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing follows <hi>Korah,
Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> and certainly if the infernal <hi>Tophet</hi>
be not for theſe men, it can challenge no Gueſts: For Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou
that art uſed to curſe, thou art a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer in heart, and in Gods acount,
in wiſhing him that croſſeth thee the Pox, Plague, or that he were
Hanged, or Damned, nor will it be any rare thing at the day of Iudgement, for
Curſers to be indited of Murther, for like <hi>Shimei</hi> or <hi>Goliah</hi>
to <hi>David,</hi> thou wouldſt kill him if thou durſt: I would be loath to
truſt his hands, that bans me with his tongue. But let them, then the beſt
of them that uſe to curſe (for I paſs over them that call for a curſe
upon themſelves, ſaying, <hi>God damn me, confound me, the devil take
me,</hi> and the like: which would make a rational man even trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to name,
becauſe I were as good knock at a dead mans Grave, as ſpeak to them,) let
them, I ſay, take notice what will be the iſſue: the cauſeleſs
curſe ſhall not come where the curſer meant it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 36.2. Yea,
though thou curſeſt, yet God will bleſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109.28. But thy
curſes ſhall be ſure to rebound back into thine own breaſt,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.14,15,16. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.30. Curſing mouths are like
ill-made Pieces, <pb n="17" facs="tcp:151210:36"/> which while men diſcharge at others,
recoyl in ſplinters on their own faces: their words and wiſhes be but
whirlwinds, which being breathed forth, return to the ſame place: as hear how
the Holy Ghoſt delivers it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 109. As he loved curſing, ſo
ſhall it come unto him, and as he loved not bleſſing, ſo ſhall it be
far from him: as he cloathed himſelf with curſing like a garment, ſo
ſhall it came into his bowels like water, and like o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

17,18,19. Here this all ye whoſe tongues run ſo faſt on the Devils
errand, you loved curſing, you ſhall have it, both upon you, about you, and
in you, and that everlaſtingly, if you perſevere and go on; for Chriſt
himſelf at the laſt day, even he which came to ſave the world, ſhall

prepared for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his Angels, Mat.</hi> 24.41. <hi>where they ſhall
do nothing but curſe for evermore.</hi> For Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whence do theſe
Monſters of the earth, theſe helliſh Miſcreants, theſe bodily and
viſible Devils learn this their damnable Curſing and Swearing? are not
their tongues fired and edged from Hell? as St. <hi>James</hi> hath it,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 3.6. Yea, it is the very language of the damned, as you may
ſee, <hi>Rev.</hi> 16.1,21. only they learn it <pb n="18" facs="tcp:151210:37"/> here,
before they come thither, and are ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients therein, that the devil
counts them his beſt Schollars, and ſets them in his higheſt form,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1. and well they deſerve it, with whom the language of
Hell is ſo familiar, that Blaſphemy is become their Mother-tongue. If they
be croſſed by ſome one, perhaps their Wife or Child, or Servant, or

wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plague of God, or Gods vengeance to light on them, or ſome
ſuch helliſh ſpéech falls from their foul mouth: and ſo upon

how can it be otherwiſe? they do not only infect their Companions, but

doth not this kéep them off from embracing the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

wonder that Swearers, Drunkards, and all ſuch wicked and prophane wretches

their blaſphemies, and bandy the dreadful name of God in their impure and
poluted mouths, would take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby, and not ſtill perſiſt in
their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practice to ſwear and curſe, as if he that made the ear,
could not hear; or as if he were neither to be feared, nor cared for: who for

the old World, rained down fire and brimſtone upon <hi>Sodom,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the earth to open her mouth and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed down quick <hi>Korah</hi> and his
company: he who ſmote <hi>Egypt</hi> with ſo many plagues, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt in the red-ſea, deſtroyed great and mighty
Kings, giving their Land for an inheritance to his people: and can as eaſily
with a word of his mouth, ſtrike them dead, while they are blaſpheaming
him, and <pb n="21" facs="tcp:151210:38"/> caſt them body and ſoul into Hell, for their
odious unthankfulneſs: yea, it is a mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond expreſſion, that he
hath ſpared them ſo long.</p>
                  <p>When a Dog flyes in his maſters face that keeps him, we
concludue him mad: are you then rational men, that being never ſo little
croſt, will flye in your makers face, and tear your Saviours name in pieces
with oaths and execrations, which is worſe then frenzy: no, you are
demoniacal, Obſeſſed, or rather poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Devil, and more

gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity of Men and Women in the world are hindred from a ſerious
applying of themſelves to ſeek after <pb n="2" facs="tcp:151210:42"/> life and
happineſs, I find this one thing to lie as a ſtumbling-block in the way of
a great many: That is to ſay, <hi>The Diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which by frequent
controverſies and diſputings are ſo reſolutely maintained by men
profeſſing godlineſs, who are of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent perſwations.</p>
                  <p>For this very cauſe, many are apt to reaſon with
themſelves after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
                  <p>There are ſo many Religions abroad in the World, that a man
cannot tell which to chuſe; one ſaith this is the true way, another
ſaith, that's the true way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One ſaith: <hi>Lo here is Chriſt;</hi>
another ſaith, <hi>Lo there is Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some ſay the <hi>Epiſcopal. man,</hi> thoſe which
ſtand for the Common Prayer, and other Ceremonies, that they are Gods people:
Others ſay, the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> are more likely to be the people of
God: a third ſort ſay the <hi>Independants</hi> way of worſhipping is the
right way: a fourth ſort ſay, the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> way is moſt
agreeable to the word of God, a fifth ſort ſay, the <hi>Quakers,</hi> are 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151210:42"/> the only People to whom the will of God is known.</p>
                  <p>Thus ſo many men' ſo many minds, and we know not whom to
beleive, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had as good ſit ſtill and do nothing as to do
ſomething to no purpoſe: And hereupon they continue to go on in ſinful
courſes: following the deſires of their own hearts, and never ſo much as
ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the knowledge of God, whereby they might come unto his fear, and
be happy for ever.</p>
                  <p>But my friends, let me tell you theſe things ought not to
be: but ſuch conſequences will end in deſperate and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
concluſions For although it were greatly to be wiſhed and deſired, that
all thoſe that fear the Lord were of <hi>one heart,</hi> and of <hi>one
minde,</hi> yet fince the Lord in Wiſdom is pleaſed to ſuffer his people
to be ſome of one minde, and ſome of another, concerning circumſtantial
and ceremonial things, for in the fundamentals and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Religion,
and in all things that are abſolutely neceſſary for ſalvation: they do
joyntly agree: But ſeeing I ſay, God is pleaſed to permit ſuch as truly
fear him, to be of different perſwaſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <pb n="4" facs="tcp:151210:43"/>
things leſs conſiderable, this ſhould in no wiſe diſcourage us from
ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but rather ſtir us up with much more fervency and earneſtneſs
to ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> out the true way, and to
finde out what the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able will of the Lord is that ſo by doing the
ſame, we may purchaſe reſt and quietneſs to our Souls. And that no one
may think their labour herein will be in vain here what the Lord ſaith, ask
and ye ſhall have, ſeek and ye ſhall finde. Here is the word of the holy
and true God for thy ſecurity, he hath faithfully promiſed, that if thou
doſt ſeek thou ſhalt find; and again, Chriſt ſaith, If any man doth
the Will of my Father he ſhall know the Doctrine; that is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God
ſees a willing mind, and that any poor Creature doth truly deſire to fear
him, and to keep his Commandements then he will reveal to that Soul ſo much
of his will as is needful for its preſent ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and future
happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now to encourage us farther in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this ſo
neceſſary and profitable a duty the Lord hath been pleaſed ſo far to
condiſcend to our weak capacities, as that he hath ſet before our eyes all
thoſe <pb n="5" facs="tcp:151210:43"/> things which are of greateſt concernment, in
ſuch plain and legible Charcters, as he that runs may read them, and not only
ſo, but he hath alſo graciouſly promiſed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give us what he
doth require of us, and to enable us to perform whatever he commands us to do:
therefore we have no reaſon to have harſh thoughts concerning God, or to
account him a hard Task-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, for the ways of God are pleaſantneſs,
and his paths peace. The Yoke of Chriſt is eaſie, and his Burthen
light.</p>
                  <p>Doth God command thee to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him? why he will give
thee faith whereby thou ſhalt be able to do it; for faith is the gift of God
he is both the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and the finiſher thereof: doth he bid thee repent?
why he will grant thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto life, he will turn thee, and thou
ſhalt be turned, doth he require a new heart? why he hath promiſed to give
a new heart, a ſoft and tender heart, ſuch as ſhall bleed for the leaſt
prick of Sin: doth he command thee to love him? why he hath ſaid, I will
circumciſe thy heart, that thou ſhalt love me with all thy heart, and with
all thy ſtrength: doth he command <pb n="6" facs="tcp:151210:44"/> thee to fear him? why
'tis his promiſe to put his fear into thy inward parts, and to write his Law
in thy heart, and ſo in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, 'tis he that works both to will
and to do of his own good pleaſure: for we cannot of our ſelves or in our
own ſtrength do any thing that is good, but our duty is to wait upon God, for
in him we live, move and have our being, he it is that hath created us, 'tis he
that cloathes and feeds us, and preſerves our lives: from him alone, we are
to expect new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes of whatſoever is needful for our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and
Well-being in this world and alſo in reference to our future happineſs
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaid: My freſh ſprings are in
thee: the well-ſpring of life flow from God, as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>He that
believeth on me, out of his Belly ſhall flow forth Rivers of Living Water;
whereof whoſoever drinketh, ſhall live for ever:</hi> God is the fountain
of all goodneſs, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever our Souls can deſire, 'tis to be found in
him, and he communicates out of his fulneſs unto the neceſſities of poor
creatures, but it is through Chriſt, for he is Gods treaſury and
ſtore-houſe. It hath pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould all 
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:151210:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> fulneſs dwel, he receives of his Eather, and gives
to us all things requiſite and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both for Soul and Body: he it
is that of God is made unto us wiſdom, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, ſanctification
and redemption; by him we have acceſs with boldneſs unto the Throne of
Grace, and all the petitions we put up to the Father in his name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on
him we ſhall be heard therein, and our requeſts ſhall be granted: ſo
far as it ſhall be for Gods glory and our good. Chriſt is that new &amp;
living way in which God will meet with us and bleſs us and cauſe his face
to ſhine upon us, by the light of whoſe countenance, our hearts are made
more glad then in the time when Corn and Wine, and Oyl encreaſed: Oh!
therefore let every one ſtrive to get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt who alone is
worth more then all the world bſiede, he is the true Riches that will make us
happy to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; he hath purchaſed ſalvation for all that will
forſake their ſins, and come and accept of his free tender of Grace for all
that will lay down thoſe weapons, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they have been taking Sathans
part, and fighting againſt God, if they will now lay hold upon his mercy, and
upon his <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151210:45"/> ſtrength, and are willing to be reconciled to
God, they ſhall be received into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: for whoſoever cometh unto me,
ſaith Chriſt, ſhall in no wiſe be caſt out; for God ſo loved the
world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him
ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life, <hi>John</hi> 3.15.19. It
was Gods purpoſe in ſending his Son, and Chriſts deſign in coming into
the World, that poor loſt ſinners should be reſtored to that eſtate of
happineſs, which they had loſt in the fall, and from this free proffer of
grace none are exempted, for God hath made an open Proclamation. <hi>Ho every

we ſee that all are invited to come to Chriſt, from the higheſt to the

in ſending Chriſt to dye for us and in laying upon him the iniquities of us
all: and Chriſt hath done his part in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="9" facs="tcp:151210:45"/> the Law
for us, and in undergoing the wrath of God, and the Curſe of the Law, which
was due to our ſins: and the ſpirit hath revealed the ſame unto us, and
is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten knocking at the Doors of our hearts, and calling us to repentance,
but if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witſtanding all this we will fully perſiſt in evil, and
refuſe to hearken to the voice of God, but hearden our hearts, and make light
of Chriſt, then it will be juſt with God, to leave us to our ſelves, and
let us perish in our own doings, which the Lord us unwilling to do, for as the
Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſaith, <hi>He would fain have all men to be

a ſinner, but rather that he would return from his wickedneſs and

that he will not accept of mercy upon Gods terms although never ſo

                  <p>The great Controverſie betwixt God and Man, is about the
Will, God would have his Will and Man would have his will: as Chriſt ſaith:

that will rather go to Hell by following the deſires of their own wills, then
to Heaven by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying the will of God which is holy and righteous, and is made

Deſtruction, as in our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but he pitties our condition, and is
pleaſed ſo far to condiſcend as to entreat and beſeech us to conſider
our latter end: and whilſt he gives us life, and means of repentance to come
in and be reconciled unto him, 'tis we that are enemies to God, God never was
an enemy to us yet he firſt ſeeks us before we ſeek him: O the Depth of

ſuffering and kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vile ſinful Creatures: Let this

bringeth ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: <hi>O therefore

                  </p>
                  <p>Why ſhould any ſinner ſtand off: doth the multitude of
thy ſins affright thee? why Gods mercies are infinite, he can blot out thy
tranſgreſſions, though never ſo many: he will abundantly pardon this is
a faithful ſaying, ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation,
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am
cheif.</hi> If thou be the cheif of Sinners, thou art but ſuch a one as
Chriſt came to ſave, doſt thou queſtion whether Chriſt can ſave
thee? why the Apoſtle tells thee, He is able to ſave to the utmoſt all
that come to the father by him doſt thou want faith? go and ſay: <hi>Lord I
believe, Lord help my unbelief.</hi> Doſt thou want wiſdom? ask of God who

Sins, and yet findeſt little ſtrength to do it? ſay unto the Lord,

If the five foolish Virgins had been in the way, they might have gon into the

Becauſe he meditated in the Law of God day and <pb n="15" facs="tcp:151210:48"/> night, he
was continually praying to God, morning and evening, and at midnight, he roſe
early to call upon the Lord, and he found the benefit of it, as is expreſt at
large in the book of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> therefore let prayer and meditation
accompany our hearing: But then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt yield unto all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, when
ever the word of God doth convince of ſin, when he doth Alarum us to come in,
let us take heed that we ſtand it not out, when it comes to a drunkard, and
ſaith: <hi>Thou canſt not go to Heaven:</hi> Then hearken to this and leave
thy drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and when it Alarums the ſwearer or proud perſon, or
covetous, or unclean perſon, or whomſoever, when it ſtrikes thee upon the
heart and ſaith: <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> O then fall down and ſay as
<hi>Saul</hi> did: <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Whatever the
ſin be that God convince thee of, though it be as dear to thee as thy right
eye, or thy right hand, yet pluck it out, or cut it off, and caſt it from
thee, and that is the way to procure Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the means, ſo
that it ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the end for which it is appointed. But if thou
art unwilling to forſake thy <pb n="16" facs="tcp:151210:49"/> ſins and to part with thy
luſts, and yet ſtill hopeſt to find mercy in the end, and to be ſaved
by Chriſt: Let me beſeech thee to put ſuch thoughts far from thy heart,
and let not the Devil any longer delude thee therewith, leſt thou miſerably
deceive thy own Soul, for he that hideth his ſins ſhall not proſper; 'tis
only he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them who ſhall find mercy:
Chriſt did not come to ſave thee in thy ſins, but from thy ſins: if he
be thy Prieſt to ſave thee, he will alſo be thy King to rule and govern
thee: thou muſt no longer live to thy ſelf but to him that dyed for thee,
he hath bought thee with a price, he hath paid thy ranſome, he hath ſhed
his pretious blood to redeem thee, and thou art to obey him, and to do whatever
he commands thee to do, thou muſt part with thy old companions, I mean thy
darling ſins, and boſome luſts, which thou haſt took ſuch pleaſure
in, and now thou muſt walk in newneſs of life, for if any man be in
Chriſt he is a new Creature old things are paſſed away, behold all things

thou muſt mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, and ſerve <pb n="17" facs="tcp:151210:49"/>
the Lord with thy ſpirit and truth, ſo ſin ſhall not have dominion over

very wicked have La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for it, who are aſhamed of other Vertues, they
that care not for one Dram of Goodneſſe, would yet have a full ſcale of
Knowledge, as O the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that rational Men take in it! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all
the Trees in the Garden, none ſo pleaſeth them as the Tree of Knowledge,
<hi>Pro. 2.3.</hi> and <hi>10.14. Phil. 3.8.</hi> And as wiſdome is excellent
above all, ſo it is affected of all, as Oyl was both of the Wiſe and
Fooliſh Virgins. It hath been a mark that every Man hath ſhot at ever
ſince. <hi>Eve</hi> ſought to be as Wiſe as her Maker, but as a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
ſhoot for one that hit the White, ſo an hundred aim at Wiſdome, for one
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lights upon it, <hi>Eccleſ. 7.28.</hi> Becauſe they are miſtaken in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing, for as <hi>Jacob</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dark miſtook <hi>Leah</hi> for
<hi>Rachel,</hi> ſo many a blind ſoul takes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to be Wiſdome, which is
not like <hi>Eve,</hi> who thought it wiſdome to eat the forbidden Fruit, and
<hi>Abſolom</hi> 
                     <pb facs="tcp:151210:53"/> who thought it Wiſdome to lye with his
Fathers Concubines in the fight of all the People, and the falſe Steward who
thought it wiſdome to deceive his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and ſo of <hi>Joſephs</hi>
Brethren, of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> and his deep Counſellours: of
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel,</hi> of <hi>Herod,</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in their
project to deſtroy Ieſus, and many the like; all theſe thought they did
wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but they were miſtaken, and their projects proved fooliſh, and
turned to their own ruine: For indeed the beſt knowledge is about the beſt
things, and the perfection of all knowledge to know God and our ſelves:
Knowledge and Learning ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> conſiſteth not ſo
much in the Quantity as in the quality, nor in the greatneſſe but in the
good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it. A little Gold we know is more worth then much Droſſe,
a little Diamond then a rocky Mountain: ſo one Drop of Wiſdome guided by
the fear of God, one ſpark of Spiritual experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and ſaving Knowledge
is more worth then all humane Wiſdome, and Learning, yea one ſcruple of
holineſſe, one Dram of Faith, one Grain of grace, is more worth than many
pounds of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <pb facs="tcp:151210:54"/> parts, and indeed Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe are
the Nerves and Sinews, yea the ſoul of Saving Knowledge: what ſaith
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> No more than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of goodneſſe maketh one
to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a good man, no more doth the Knowledge of Wiſdome alone cauſe
any perſon properly to be called a Wiſe man: Saving Knowledge of the Truth
worketh a love of the Truth Known: yea it is an uniform conſent of Knowledge
and Action. He onely is wiſe for his own Soul. He whoſe Conſcience
pulleth all, he hears and reads to his Heart, and his Heart to God, who turneth
his Knowledge to Faith, his Faith to féel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all to walk worthy of
his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. He that ſubdues his ſenſual deſires and appetite to the
noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Reaſon and Vnderſtanding, and makes that
underſtanding of his to ſerve him, by whom it is and doth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: he
that ſubdues his Luſts to his Will, ſubmits his will to reaſon, his
reaſon to faith, his faith, his reaſon, his Will, himſelf to the Will of
God, this is practical experimental and Saving Knowledge, to which the other is
but a <pb facs="tcp:151210:54"/> bare Name or Title. A competent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate (we know) well
husbanded is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a vaſt patrimony neglected, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any meer Man
ſince the firſt, knew ſo much as <hi>Solomon,</hi> many that have known
leſſe, have had more command of themſelves. Alas! they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the wiſeſt that know moſt, for none more wiſe and learned in the Worlds
account than the Scribes and Phariſees, yet Chriſt calls them four times
Blind, and twice Fools in one Chapter, <hi>Mat. 23.</hi> And the like of
<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam, 2 Pet. 2.16.</hi> Who had ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical knowledge, that
ſcarce any of the Prophets had a clearer Revelation of the Meſſiah to
come, and the ſame may be of <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Achitophel,</hi> for many
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> know a great deal leſſe are far wiſer, yea one poor crucified Thief
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converted in an hours time, had more true wiſdome and knowledge
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into him, than had all the Rulers, Scribes and Phariſees: It is
very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveable what the High Prieſt told the council when they were
ſet to condemn Chriſt, ye know nothing at all, he ſpake truer than he
meant it, for if we know <pb facs="tcp:151210:55"/> not the Lord Ieſus, our knowledge is
ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing or nothing worth, rightly a man knows no more than what he
pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſeth. It is ſaid of Chriſt, he knew no ſin, <hi>2 Cor.
5.21.</hi> Becauſe he did no ſin. In which ſence he knows no good that
doth no good. Theſe things if ye know, ſaith our Saviour, Happy are ye if
ye do them, <hi>John. 13.17.</hi> And in <hi>Deut. 4.6.</hi> Keep the
Commandments of God and do them, for this is your Wiſdome and Vnderſtanding
before God and man, what is the national ſweetneſſe of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to the
experimental caſt of it, it is one thing to know what riches are, and another
thing to be Maſter of them, it is not the knowing but the poſſeſſing
of them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> makes rich: Many have a depth of Knowledge, and yet are not
Soul-wiſe, have a library of Divinity in their Heads, not ſo much as the
leaſt Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm in their Conſciences, full Brains, empty Hearts: yea you
ſhall hear a flood in the Tongue, when you cannot ſée one Drop in
the Life, inſomuch that in the midſt of ſo much light and means of Grace,
there be few I fear that have the found and ſaving Knowledge of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus 
<pb facs="tcp:151210:55"/> Chriſt and him Crucified, which was the onely care and ſtudy
of St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 2.2.</hi> And that I am not miſtaken, the effect
ſhews, for if Men knew either God or Chriſt they could not but love him,
and loving him they would keep his Commandments, <hi>John 14.15.</hi> For
hereby ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> it is manifeſt that we know him, if we
kéep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>John 2.3.</hi> But he that ſaith I know
him and yet keepeth not his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments is a Lyar, and there is no Truth in
him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. What ſaith our Saviour? This is Life Eternal to know
thee, the onely true God and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent: But how
ſhall a Man know whether be hath this knowledge? Anſwer. St. <hi>John</hi>
tells you in theſe laſt Words mentioned, and ſo plainly that you cannot
be deceived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you deſire to deceive your own Soul. The Knowledge
of God that ſaves us is more than a bare apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of him, it knows his
power, and therefore fears him, knows his juſtice, and therefore ſerves
him, knows his Mercy and therefore truſts him, knows his Goodneſſe and
therefore Loves <pb facs="tcp:151210:56"/> him, &amp;c. For he that hath the Saving
Knowledge of God and of Chriſt hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Grace: There is a ſweet
corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between every one, where there is any one in truth, as in the
Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration the head is not without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor the body without each
Member, nor the Soul without its powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ſo in the
Regeneration, where there is any one Grace in Truth there is every one, <hi>2
Cor. 5.17.</hi> If you will ſee it in particulars read, <hi>Pſal. 9.10.
Jer. 9.24. John 4.10. Job 42.5.6. 1 John 4.6,7.</hi> Which Scriptures ſhew
that as feeling it inſeparable to all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of ſence, the Eye ſees
and feels, the ear hears and feels, the Pallat taſts and feels, the
Noſtrils ſmell and feel, ſo Knowledge is involved in every Grace. Faith
knows and believes, charity knows and loves, patience knows and ſuffers,
Temperance knows and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtains, Humilitie knows and floops, repentance knows
and ſtoops, obedience knows and does, Confidence knows and rejoyceth, Hope
knows and expects, Compaſſion knows and pities. Yea as there is a power of
Water in every <pb facs="tcp:151210:56"/> thing that grows, it is fatneſſe in the Olive,
Sweetneſſe in the Fig, Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe in the Grape, Strength in the
Oak, Tallneſſe in the Cedar, Redneſſe in the Roſe, Whiteneſſe in
the Lilly, &amp;c. So Knowledge is in the Hand, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in the Mouth,
Benediction in the Knee, Humility in the Eye, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in the Heart,
Charity in the whole Body, and Soul Piety. Alas! if men had the true Knowledge
of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, it would diſperſe and diſpel all the Black Clouds
of their reigning ſins in a Moment, as the Sun doth no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhew his
Face but the Darkneſſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth, or as <hi>Ceſar</hi> did no ſooner
look upon his Enemies but they were gone: He cannot delight in Sin, nor dote
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this World that knows Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly: Vertue is ordained a Wife for
Knowledge, and where theſe two joyn, their will proceed from them a Noble
Progeny, a Generation of good Works. Again, as the Water engendereth Ice, and
the Ice again engendereth water, ſo Knowledge begets Righteouſneſſe,
and Righteouſneſſe again begets Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: When <hi>Solomon</hi> would
acquaint us <pb facs="tcp:151210:57"/> how to become Wiſe, he tells us that the fear of
the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdome, <hi>Prov. 1.7.</hi> As if the firſt
leſſon to be Wiſe were to be Holy: If it be asked why the Natural Man
perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the things of the Spirit of God, St. <hi>Paul</hi> anſwers he
cannot know them becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcernd, how ſhould they
diſcern them, that have not the Spirit, for though the outward Man receives
the Elements and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of Religion by Breeding and Education, yet his
inward Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them by heavenly Inſpiration, <hi>1 Cor. 2.11,12,13.
Mat. 16.16,17. Luk. 24.45. Jo. 15.15.</hi> And this alone is enough to prove
that no Wicked Man is a Wiſe Man, for if God alone be the giver of it we may
be ſure that he will reveal his Secrets to none but ſuch as he knows will
improve their Knowledge to his Glory, and the good of others, even as the
Husbandmen will not caſt his Seed but into Ground that will return him a good
Harveſt, <hi>Pſal. 25.14. Mark 4.3,4. 1 John 4.7. Gen. 18.17.</hi> A great
many Men deſire Knowledge, for no other end but to remove their ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, 
<pb facs="tcp:151210:57"/> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> uſed <hi>Moſes</hi> but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the
Plagues, others again ſtudy the Scriptures, and other good Books onely to
make gain thereof, or to be the abler to diſpute and diſcourſe, as Boys
go into the water only to play and padle there, not to waſh and be clean,
with <hi>Eve</hi> they highly deſire the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but regard not
the Tree of Life, for if we conſider what Fruit or Effect doth the Knowledge
of moſt Men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in them, except it be to inable them to diſpute and
diſcourſe to increaſe wit, or to increaſe wealth, or to increaſe
pride or perhaps to increaſe Atheiſm, and to make them the more able and
cunning to argue againſt the Truth and power of Religion, is not the utmoſt
of their aim to enrich, dignifie, and pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not once
caſting the Eye of their Souls at Gods Glory, their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good, or
their own Salvation; is it not their Main Drift to purchaſe a great eſtate
for them and theirs without either fear of God, regard of Men, or the
diſcharge of their Duty, and calling, and for the moſt part of theſe men,
if they may be thought great Rabies, déep <pb facs="tcp:151210:58"/> and profound
ſchollars, this is the height of their ambition, though neither the Church be
benefited, nor God be glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it; whereas they ought the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for
as the Grace of God is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from which our wiſdom flows, ſo the
Glory of God ſhould be the Ocean to which it ſhould run: yea, that God may
be honoured with and by our wiſdom, is the only end for which he gives us to
be wiſe. Now they that are puft up with their knowledge, or do not part with
their ſins, ſhew that they never ſought it for Gods Glory, and certainly
if we ſéek not Gods Glory, in doing his work, he will give us no

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ges at the latter end. But for
men to do no good with their gifts, is not all: yea, it were well if that were
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt, for not a few of them reſemble <hi>Achitophel,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Jonadab</hi> who imployed their wit wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and do miſchief inſtead
of good with their wiſdom, like <hi>Herod:</hi> whom you ſhall ſée
turning over the Bible, ſearching the Scriptures, examining the Prophets, but
to what end and purpoſe? To know good, but to do evil: yea, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt
evil under y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſun, ſlay Chriſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cradle: with many their Learning
and knowledge is not for God, &amp; for <hi>Gideon,</hi> but for Antichriſt,
&amp; for <pb facs="tcp:151210:58"/> 
                     <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; ſo of all other gifts: how
many are the worſe for them? as give <hi>Saul</hi> a Kingdom, and he will
tirannize, give <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> plenty, &amp; he will be drunk: give
<hi>Judas</hi> an Apoſtleſhip, and he will ſell his Maſter for Money:
let <hi>Sarmantus</hi> have a good wit he will exerciſe it in ſcoffing at
Holineſs: Briefly, how oft doth Wiſdom without grace, prove like a fair
eſtate in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of a Fool, which not ſeldom becomes the owners ruine,
or <hi>Abſaloms</hi> Hair, which was an Ornament wherewith he hanged
himſelf: ſo that wiſdom without grace, is but a cuning way of undoing our
ſelves: at laſt, when our knowledge makes us prouder, not better: more
rebellious, not more ſerviceable: as it is in <hi>Iſa. 47.10. Thy Wiſdom
&amp; thy Knowledge, they have cauſed thee to err,</hi> &amp; very often this
falls out: that as the beſt ſoyl uſually yeildeth the worſt Ayr, ſo
without grace there is nothing more peſtilent than a déep wit, no
ſuch prey for the Devil as a great wit unſanctified. Now when it comes to
this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they fight againſt God with the weapon he hath given them, when
with thoſe the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of, <hi>Pſal. 73.9.</hi> They ſet
their Mouth againſt Heaven, and <pb facs="tcp:151210:59"/> are like an unruly Iade that
being full fed kicks at his Maſter, what courſe doth the Lord take with
them? Read but that parable, <hi>Luk. 19.24. John 7.17.</hi> and it will inform
you, for to him that uſeth his talent of Knowledge well, he giveth more, but
to them which uſe not their knowledge well; much more if they abuſe it, he
taketh away that which he had formerly given them: I will turn the wiſe men
backward, and make their knowledge fooliſhneſs, ſaith the Lord,
<hi>Iſa. 44.25.</hi> He taketh the wiſe in their own craftineſſe,
<hi>and the counſel of the wicked is made fooliſh, Job 5.13.</hi> and
moſt juſt it is, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> they who want grace ſhould want wit too. But
further, Theſe great Knowers, &amp; wiſe men, are ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
ſoul-wiſdom, &amp; ſaving knowledge, to the ends before ſpecified, that
they do not at all deſire it, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſuits not with their Condition,
for natural men deſire only humane &amp; mundane knowledge, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual men,
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is heavenly &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, &amp; the reaſon why they
deſire it not, is for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they know it not. A man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he
knoweth not, neither are unknown evils feared, ſaith <hi>Chriſoſtom;</hi>
wherefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work of regeneration begins <pb facs="tcp:151210:59"/> at Illumination,
<hi>Act. 26.16. Col. 1.13.</hi> Now acording as men are wiſe, they prize
&amp; value this wiſdom, &amp; endeavour to obtain it, <hi>Prov. 18.15.</hi>
and ſo on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary; according as men are ignorant &amp; blockiſh, they
undervalue and diſeſtéem it, hate it, &amp; are prejudic'd againſt
it, &amp; hereupon carnal men being blinded by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prince of darkneſs,
together with their own wickedneſs, and being of a reprobate judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do
moſt uſually term and eſtéem this Soul-wiſdom, this Divine,
ſpiritual, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, &amp; ſaving knowledge to be méer
fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, or madneſs, <hi>Wiſd. 5.3,</hi> to <hi>9.</hi> &amp; the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors thereof to be fools &amp; madmen; <hi>Eliſha</hi> was counted
no better, <hi>2 King. 9.11.</hi> &amp; the reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophets, <hi>Hoſ.
9.7.</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul, Act. 26.20.</hi> &amp; all the Apoſtles, <hi>1 Cor.
4.10.</hi> yea, our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, with open mouth was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
mad by his carnal hearers, <hi>Jo. 10.20. Mar. 3.21.</hi> to worldly men,
Chriſtian wiſdom ſéems folly, ſaith <hi>Gregory,</hi> &amp; well
it may, for even the wiſdom of God is fooliſhneſs with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, <hi>1
Cor. 1.18.</hi> therefore no diſparagement to Gods ſervants, if the wiſe
men, &amp; polititi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world repute them fools: nor any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to
ſuch Senſualiſts y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo repute them. However, to give ſuch men their
due, we grant y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſome kind of skill they outſtrip the beſt of Gods
people; who if they are put to it, may anſwer as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> did,
when one <pb facs="tcp:151210:60"/> invited him to touch a Lute, for as he ſaid, <hi>I
cannot fiddle, but I can make a ſmal town, a great ſtate:</hi> ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
godly may ſay, <hi>We cannot give a ſolid reaſon in nature, why Nilus
ſhould overflow only in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, when waters are at the loweſt: why
the Loadſtone ſhould draw Iron, or incline to the poleſtar, why a flaſh
of Lightning ſhould melt the Sword; without making any impreſſion in the
Scabard: kill the Child in the womb, and never hurt the mother: how the Waters
ſhould ſtand upon a heap, and yet not overflow the earth: why the clouds
above being heavy with water, ſhould not fall to the earth ſudainly,
ſeeing every heavy thing deſcendeth, except the reaſon which God giveth,
Gen. 1.6. Iob 3.8.8, to 12. Pſa 104.9. But we know the Myſtery of the
Goſpel, and what it is to be born anew, and can give a ſolid reaſon of
our faith; we know that God is reconciled to us, the Law ſatisfied for us,
our ſins pardoned, our ſouls acquited, and that we are in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with
God, which many of theſe with their great Learning, do not know, and thus the
godly are proved wiſer then the wiſeſt Humaniſt that wants
Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You have likewiſe the reaſons why theſe great knowers
know nothing, yet as they might and ought to know.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, becauſe they are miſtaken in the thing, they
take ſpeculative knowledge for ſoul-wiſdom, and ſoul-ſaving knowledge
to be fooliſhneſs and madneſs: now if a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the mark, and theſe men are as one
that is gone a good part of his journey, but muſt come back again, becauſe
he hath miſtaken his way. Secondly, Becauſe they are unregenerate, and want
the Eye of Faith. Thirdly, For that they ſeek not to God for it, who is the
giver there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and without whoſe ſpirit there is no attaining it.
Fourthly, Becauſe they are proud, and ſo ſeek not after it, ſupoſing
they have it already. Fifthly, Becauſe if they <pb facs="tcp:151210:60"/> had never ſo
much knowledge, they would be never the holier or the better for it, but rather
the worſe: nor would they imploy it to the honour of God, or the good of
others. Sixthly, becauſe they either do or would do miſchief, inſtead of
good, with their knowledge. Sevently, becauſe they will not conſult with
the word about it, nor adviſe with others that have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to it:
or thus, they read and hear the Scriptures, but mind not (I mean) the
ſpirituality of the word, or mind, and underſtand not, or underſtand and
remember not, or remember and practice not. No, this they intend not: of the
reſt: and they that are unwiling to obey, God thinks unworthy to know. When
the Serpent taught knowledge, he ſaid, if ye eat the forbiden fruit, your
eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall know good and evil: but God teacheth
another leſſon, and ſaith, if ye will not eat the forbiden fruit, your
eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall know good and evil, Ro. 12.12. Pſ. 119
97, to 100. or if you do eat, you ſhall be like Images that have ears but
cannot hear, Rom. 11.8. Iſa. 6.10. Mat. 13.14.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all which reaſons we may collect that there are but a
few amongſt us that are wiſe indéed, &amp; to purpoſe, for theſe
ſeven hindrances are apliable to 77 parts of men in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beſides, if theſe great knowers know ſo little, how
ignorant are the rude rable, that deſpiſe all knowledge? nor can it be
denied but all Impenitent perſons who prefer their profits and pleaſures
before pleaſing of God are errant fools, for if they were wiſe ſaith
Bernard, they would foreſee the torments of Hell, and prevent them: and ſo
wiſe are the godly, for they prefer Grace and Glory, and Gods favour, before
ten thouſand worlds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now if any be deſirous to get this ſpiritual, and
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental knowledge, this divine and ſupernatural wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, let them
obſerve theſe five Rules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, let ſuch a ſoul reſolve to practice what he
doth <pb facs="tcp:151210:61"/> already know, or ſhall hereafter be acquainted with, from
the word of God and Chriſts faithful Meſſengers, for he that will do my
Fathers will, ſaith our Saviour, ſhall know the Doctrine, whether it be of
God or no, Joh. 7.17. A good underſtanding have all they that keep the
Commandments, ſaith Holy David, Pſa. 111.10. and proves it true by his own
example and experience. I underſtood, ſaith he, more then the Antient, and
become wiſer then my Teachers, becauſe I kept thy Precepts, Pſa. 119.97,
to 100. To a man that is good in his ſight, God giveth knowledge and
wiſdom, Eccleſ. 2.26. The ſpiritual man underſtandeth all things, 1
Cor. 2.15. Wicked men underſtand not judgement, but they that ſeek the
Lord, underſtand all things, Prov. 28.5. Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable encouragements for men to
become godly and conſcientious: I mean practical Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, if thou wouldſt get this precious grace of
ſaving knowledge, the way is to be frequent in hearing the word preached, and
to become ſtudious in the Scriptures, for they, and they alone, make wiſe
to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 2 Tim. 3.15. Ye err, ſaith our Saviour, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the
Scriptures, Mat. 22.29. We muſt not in the ſearch of heavenly matters
either do as we ſee others do, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we follow the blind guide,
carnal reaſon, or the deceitful guide, our corrupt hearts, but the
unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable and infallible guide of Gods word, which is truth it ſelf; and
great need there is, for as we cannot perceive the foulneſs of our faces,
unleſs it be told us, or we take a Glaſs and look our ſelves therein,
ſo neither can we ſee the blemiſhes of our ſouls, which is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
degree of ſpiritual wiſdome; but either God muſt make it known to us by
his ſpirit, or we muſt collect the ſame out of the Scripture that
celeſtial glaſs, though this alſo muſt be done by the ſpirits help:
Therefore,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, If thou wilt be ſoul-wiſe and truly profit by
ſtudying the Scriptures, be frequent &amp; fervent in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to God who is
the only giver of it for the direction <pb facs="tcp:151210:61"/> of his holy Spirit, for
firſt humble and faithful prayer uſhered in by meditation is the cure of
all obſcurity, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially being accompanied with fervour and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency: as
you may ſee, Math. 21.22. If any want wiſdom ſaith St. James let him ask
of God who giveth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man, and it ſhall
be given him, Jam. 1.5. Mark the words, it is ſaid, if any, wherefore let no
man deny his ſoul this comfort, again ask and have, it cannot come on
eaſier terms, yea God ſeems to like this ſuit ſo well in Solomon, as if
he were beholding to his Creature for wiſhing well to it ſelf. And in vain
do we e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pect that alms of grace,
for which we do not ſo much as beg, but in praying for wiſdome do not pray
for it without putting difference, deſire not ſo much brain knowledge as to
be ſoul-wiſe, and then you will imploy your wiſdome to the glory of the
giver. Let thy hearts deſire be to know God in Chriſt, Chriſt in faith,
faith in good works, to know Gods will that thou mayſt do it, &amp; before
the knowledge of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, deſire to know thy ſelf, and in thy
ſelf, not ſo much thy ſtrength as thy weakneſs, pray that thine heart
may ſerve thee as a commentary to help thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſuch points of
Religion as are moſt needful &amp; neceſſary, and that thy life may be an
expoſition of thy inward man, that there may be a ſweet harmony be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t Gods word, thy Judgment, &amp; whole
converſation, that what the natural man knoweth by roa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> thou mayſt double by feeling the ſame in thine
heart &amp; affections; as indeed experimental and ſaving knowledge is no
leſs felt then known, and I cannot tell how it comes, rather out of the
abundance of the heart, than by extream ſtudy, or rather is ſent by God
unto good men, like the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m that
was brought to Abraham, when he would have Sacrifized his Son Iſaac. When
Chriſt taught in the Temple, they asked, how knoweth this man the Scriptures,
ſeeing he never learned them? So it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Learning ſome men
have, that have no learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <pb facs="tcp:151210:62"/> like Priſcilla and Aquila, poor
Tentmakers, who were able to School Apollos that great Clerk, a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> renowned for his Learning. What can we
ſay to it, for no other reaſon can be given, but as Chriſt ſaid,
Father, ſo it pleaſeth thee. For as Jacob ſaid of his Veniſon, when his
father asked how he came by it ſo ſuddainly, becauſe the Lord thy God
brought it ſuddainly into my hands; So Holy and Righteous men do more
eaſily underſtand the words of God, than the wicked, becauſe God brings
the meaning ſuddainly to their hearts. As we read, Luk, 24. Prov. 1.23.
Pſa. 25.14. Dan. 12.10. Luk. 8.10. Mar. 3.11. Again, it is not enough to
pray, except alſo it be in Chriſts name, and according to his will,
believing to be heard for his ſake, and that it be the interceſſion of
Gods own Spirit in you, and being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of your ſins and wants,
that you chiefly pray for the pardon of ſin, the effuſion of grace, and for
the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, that you may more Firmly believe more

more conſtantly perſevere in the practiſe and profeſſion of every
duty: but above all you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> muſt
know that as Sampſons Companions could never have found out his Ridle, if
they had not plowed with his Hefer, ſo no man can know the Secrets of God,
but by the Revelation of his Spirit, 1 Cor. 12.8. Mat. 16.17. Yea, Suppoſe a
man be not inferiour to Portius or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras, who kept all things in memory
that ever they had read heard, or ſeen. To Virgil, of whom it is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if all Sciences were loſt they might be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in him. To Aben
Ezra, of whom it is ſaid, that if Knowledge had put out her Candle, at his
Brain ſhe might light it again, and that his head was a Throne of wiſdom.
Or Joſephus Scaliger, who was Skilled in 30 Languages: yet if he want the
Spirit of God to be his Teacher, he is a Dunce to the meaneſt and moſt
Illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Believer. For one neceſſary and excellent Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the
Spiritual Man, is this: He hath God for his <pb facs="tcp:151210:62"/> Teacher, he learns
the Councels of God, of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Spirit
which only knows Gods Councels. Luk. 21.15. Which is no ſmall priviledge, for
the Scholar learns quickly when the Holy Ghoſt is his Teacher. The eye

                        </gap>ees di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly when the Holy
Ghoſt doth enlighten it, with the ſpirits help, the means can never be too
weak, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, never ſtrong enough, Luke 24.44,45.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, Thou muſt get an humble conceit of thine own
wiſdom. The Firſt ſtep to Knowledge, is to know our own ignorance. We
muſt become fools in our own opinion, before we can be truly wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e; as the Apoſtle ſets it down, 1
Cor. 3.18. And indeed the opinion of over-knowing, is one of the greateſt
cauſes of our Knowing ſo little, for what we preſume to have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we ſeek not after; yea, the very Firſt Leſſon of a Chriſtian is
Humility; He will teach the humble his way, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Jam.</hi>
4.6.</hi> And he that hath not learned the firſt leſſon, is not fit to
take out a new: Pride is a great let to true wiſdom, <hi>Jam. 4.6.</hi>
Whence it comes to paſs, that few proud wits are reformed, <hi>Joh.
9.39.</hi> And for this cauſe alſo did our Saviour propound his woes to the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> his Doctrines to the people. A heart full of Pride, is
like a veſſel full of ayr. This ſelf opinion muſt be firſt blown out
of us, before Saving knowledge will be poured into us, Chriſt wil know none
but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humble, &amp; none but humble ſouls truly know Chriſt: now y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the very firſt Leſſon of a
Chriſtian: for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> it is in
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.6. <hi>He will teach the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble his way.</hi> And
<hi>Jam.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
humble.</hi> The firſt ſtep to ſaving Knowledge, is to have an humble
conceit of our own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to know our own ignorance. <hi>Behold,</hi>
(ſaith God, the high and mighty one that inhabiteth Eternity) <hi>even to
this man will I look, who is of an humble ſpirit, and <pb n="3" facs="tcp:151210:65"/>
trembleth at my word.</hi> Chriſt will own none but the humble ſoul: he
himſelf was the true pattern of Humility, whoſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we are to follow:
for he that expects Salvation by Chriſt, ought ſo to walk, even as he
walked: <hi>Learn of me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>for I am meek and
humble.</hi> And he hath pronounced a bleſſing to ſuch as imitate him
here: as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall
inherit the earth.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.12.
<hi>Whoſoever exalteth himſelf, ſhall be brought low, but whoſoever
humbleth himſelf, ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted. The Lord is high,</hi> ſaith the
Pſalmiſt, <hi>yet he beholdeth the lowly, but the proud he knoweth a far
off, Pſal.</hi> 138.6. <hi>The pride of a man ſhall bring him low, but the
humble in ſpirit ſhall enjoy Glory, Prov.</hi> 29.23. Thus you ſee it is
only to the humble ſoul, that God will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for <hi>a proud look,
and a proud heart, are an abomination to the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this Humility doth conſiſt in having a mean and low

and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; <hi>I am not worthy to unloſe the latchet of

had been ſpeaking how he had been labouring in the Goſpel, he preſently
corrects himſelf, and ſaith: <hi>Not I, but the Grace of God in me.</hi>
This is the frame of a Chriſtians ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to give all the Glory to God,
and to think every one better than himſelf. Therefore whoſoever thou art,
that art highly conceited of thy own worth, that ſeemeſt wiſe in thy own
eyes, that ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

thy good parts, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <pb n="5" facs="tcp:151210:66"/> as yet ſaweſt thy ſelf to

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>void of all goodneſs, and
utterly unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to receive any favour or bleſſing from the Lord, thou
haſt not yet attained to true Humility, nor ſet one ſtep forward towards
Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, The ſecond Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required in a
Chriſtian, is Faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth, and is
Baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that will not believe, ſhall be damned,
John.</hi> 3.15,16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only
begotten Son, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him, might not periſh, but have
ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. He that believeth not, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned already, becauſe he
hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on the only begotten Son of God.</hi> But becauſe it is
common for all ſorts of perſons to think that they do believe, and that
therefore they may lay claim to the promiſe of eternal life, I will give you
the character of a lively ſaving Faith, without which it is impoſſible to
pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. True Faith worketh by love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth our
Corruptions, and ſanctifieth the whole man throughout: ſo that our 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151210:67"/> Faith to God, is ſéen in our faithfulneſs to
men; out inviſible belief, by our viſible life; Faith and Holineſs, are
as inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as Life and Motion, the Sun and Light, Fire and Heat, Ice and
Coldneſs, Honey and Sweetneſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, Faith believeth the threats of the Words, as well as
the promiſes; and if ſuch as think they have Faith, did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth
of thoſe threatnings which God hath denounced againſt Swearers, Drunkards,
Vnclean, Covetous, Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Vnjuſt, Envious, Malicous Perſons, and
ſuch like Sinners, how durſt they then ſo wallow in theſe ſins? that
if God inſtead of Hell, had promiſed Heaven for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward unto them, they
could not do more then they do. Many do ſottiſhly deceive themſelves with
an opinion of Faith, who indeed believe not ſo much as the Devil doth, for he
believes the threatnings of the Word, and trembles for horrour; but they go on
in ſin, eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ocking at the Menaces, and in the
infidelity of their hearts, even give them the lye, ſaying, no ſuch things
ſhall befal them: but what ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>When they ſhall
ſay, peace and ſafety, then comes on them ſudden deſtruction,</hi> 1
<hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:151210:67" rendition="simple:additions"/>But Thirdly, True Faith is wrought
by the Spirit of God, in the hearing or reading the Word at the time of a mans
converſion, when God enlightens his mind, to ſee his loſt, undone, and
pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing condition, and convinceth him of his unbelief: ſo that
whoſoever never ſaw himſelf to be without Faith, hath as yet, no Faith:
for however many think it an eaſie matter to believe, yet he that goes about
it, ſhall find that it is as hard a work to believe in the Goſpel, as to
keep the Law; and only God muſt enable to both: It is eaſie indeed for a
ſoul that was never burthened with ſin, that was never ſenſible of the
filthineſs thereof, and of Gods wrath due unto it: ſuch a one thinks it a
ſmall matter to believe; but this is a ſure rule, that that perſwaſion
only which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Humiliation, is Faith, and that which goes before it is
Preſumption. Then,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, True Faith, as it is wrought by the Spirit of God,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>it brings forth the fruits of the
ſpirit; mentioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22,23. Faith never goes alone, but hath a
whole train of other Graces to follow her; as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Add to
your Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Temperance, and to Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance 
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:151210:68"/> Patience, and to Patience Brotherly kindneſs, and to
Brotherly kindneſs Charity;</hi> theſe and many more do always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a
lively Faith. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>The third Qualification which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is True
Repentance; and that is through change, wrought in the whole man, whereby he
becomes a new Creature, and turns from every ſin, to the contrary good; from
Pride, to Humility; from Drunkenneſs, to Sobriety; from Vain Diſcourſe,
to Holy Communion; from Covetouſneſs, to Liberallity; from
Laci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs, to Chaſtity: and this not only for a little while, but
even ſo long as he lives: which repentance is ever accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a hatred
of the ſin we turn from, and a love of that good we turn unto; and is
uſually procured by the conſideration of Gods unſpeakable goodneſs
towards us, according to the Apoſtle; <hi>The goodneſs of God leadeth thee
to Repentance.</hi> When we come to conſider what God hath done for us, how
he Created us after his own Image; and when by ſinning we had loſt the
ſame, and plunged our ſelves into miſery, he ſent his only Son to
redeem, and regain our happineſs, how his merits are <pb n="9" facs="tcp:151210:68"/>
renewed daily towards us, in preſerving, providing for us, and how ill we
repayed the Lord for the ſame, when inſtead of living to his Glory, we have
gloried in doing ſuch things as do greatly diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, being
rebellious, ſtubborn, diſobedient to all his Holy Laws and Commandements,
abuſing his Merits, ſlighting his Promiſes, deſpiſing his Iudgements,
and turning his Grace into Wantonneſs, thereby vexing, grieving, and
quenching his Holy Spirit: and yet, notwithſtanding this, and much more, the
Lord doth ſtill ſpare us, and let us live, whereas he might juſtly cut us
off, and caſt us into Hell: he doth ſtill wait to be gracious, he calls us
to come and accept of frée Mercy, and promiſes to pardon and paſs by
what is paſt, if for the future we will amend our lives. This is that which
makes us to loath our ſelves, to lye low before the Lord, to be exceedingly
ſorry that we ſhould be ſo vile, and ſo unworthy, as to offend ſo
gracious a God; this breeds a diſpleaſure againſt our ſelves, and our
ways, and a hatred againſt ſin: from hence ariſeth in our hearts a full
pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>poſe and reſolution 
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151210:69"/> to forſake every evil way, and to walk in newneſs of
life; and this is true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, without which none can be ſaved: <hi>for
except ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh:</hi> and <hi>except a man
be born again, he ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi>
but whoſoever doth repent him of his ſins, from the bottom of his heart,
ſo as utterly to forſake them, he ſhal find mercy: the Lord hath
promiſed it, and it ſhall ſurely be performed. But,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The next qualification I am to ſpeak of, is Love,
and that is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To God himſelf: Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart, with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To our Brethren: <hi>This is my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi>
ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that ye love one-another, even as I have loved you:</hi>
And that we may know how to expreſs our Love, he ſaith in another place,
<hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments:</hi> he that ſaith he loves God, and
yet keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar. If we have a friend that we love
dearly, how care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are we to pleaſe him? how unwilling <pb n="11" facs="tcp:151210:69"/>
to do any thing which might procure his anger? we think no labour nor pains too
much, imployed in ſerving him, we ſpare no coſt nor charge, to expreſs
our high eſteem of his friendſhip: but hath not God been a greater friend
to us then any man can be? ought we not much much more to love him, who is
infinitely worthy to be beloved for his own ſake, if he had never done any
thing for us? but now if we be careleſs in his ſervice, negligent in
performing what he requires of us, unwilling to part with any thing, that he
calls to us for, it ſeems <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>r
Love is very cold: this is not loving God with all our hearts, when we will do
more for an acquaintance, or a relation, then for him. Indeed, God doth not
ſtand in need of what we can do; he is beyond the reach of our good works:
our love cannot add to his Bleſſedneſs; as <hi>David</hi> ſaith; <hi>My
goodneſs tendeth not to thee.</hi> Yet he requires that in teſtimony of our
Love and thankfulneſs to him, for what we have received from him, we ſhould
ſhew forth the ſame in all expreſſions of Kindneſs and Charity, to
thoſe that may be benefited thereby: and it is a ſure <pb n="12" facs="tcp:151210:70"/>
rule, he that loves God, for his own ſake, will love his Brother for Gods
ſake. A true and pious Chriſtian deſtres to do ſomething for Chriſt,
who hath done and ſuffered ſo much for him, and who is pleaſed to take
that ſo kindly, which we do for his ſake, that he hath promiſed
whoſoever ſhall give but a cup of cold water in his Fame, he ſhall not go
unrewarded: Therefore if thou beareſt any good will to God or Chriſt, whom
it is not in thy power to pleaſure, thou wilt ſhew thy thankfulneſs to
him in his Children, who are bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh: it
is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he who hath Love ſhould be ungrateful: <hi>Mary
Magdalen</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived much, and this made her love much, and loving much,
ſhe thought nothiog too much to beſtow, even upon the moſt remote members
of Chriſt, to expreſs her thankfulneſs. An ingenious diſpoſition
cannot receive favours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoughts of return: <hi>Behold thou haſt been
careful for us,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eliſha</hi> to the <hi>Shunamite: with all
this care, now what is to be done for thee?</hi> ſo ſaith the true
Chriſtian: <hi>Behold O Lord, thou haſt been <pb n="13" facs="tcp:151210:70"/> exceeding
gracious, thou haſt conferred great benefits upon me, now how can I
ſufficiently expreſs my thankfulneſs unto thee, for the ſame. What
ſhall I render to the Lord for all his mercies?</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi>
Indeed all that we can do is too little, but God doth not look for ſuch Love
and Service from us, as he is worthy to receive, but as we are able to give:
and it is for our own good that he would be ſerved and magnified by us, that
ſo he may reward our labour of Love, with everlaſting bliſs and
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now the beſt way to make it appear that the Love of God is
ſhed abroad in our hearts, is to be fruitful in the Works of Piety and
Charity, Pure Religeon, and undefiled before God, ſaith St. <hi>James, Is to
viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their adverſity, and to keep himſelf
unſpotted from the World.</hi> Love is the fulfiling of the Law,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10. <hi>We ought ſo to love our Neighbour as our
ſelves.</hi> But how do we ſo, if we take not care for them, as we do for
our ſelves? Doſt thou ſee any one in affliction, or want comfort?
conſider, <pb n="14" facs="tcp:151210:71"/> if thou wert in ſuch a condition, as God
knows how ſoon thou maiſt, wouldſt not thou in thy need be relieved? Why
then ſurely 'tis reaſon thou ſhouldſt do to others, as thou wouldſt
have them do to thee; and for our encouragement to this duty of Love or
Charity. Conſider that Chriſt accounts that which is done to his poor
members here on earth, as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as appears by many expreſs
Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Scripture. <hi>VVhen I was an hungred, ye fed me; when I was
naked, ye cloathed me; when I was in priſon, ye viſited me; for in as much
as ye did it to one of theſe little ones, that believed in me, ye did it unto
me, Mat.</hi> 25.34, <hi>&amp;c. He that giveth to the poor, lendeth to the
Lord, Prov.</hi> 19.17. To do good and to diſtribute, forget not, for with
ſuch Sacrifice God is well-pleaſed: look not every man on his own things,
but every man alſo on the things of other men: let the ſame mind be in you,
which was even in Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4,5,6. He that is endued
with this Grace of Love will open his hands to ſuch as are in want: and ſo
far as his ability extends, will lend or give to them ſufficient for their
need: as God commands, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.8. It will <pb n="15" facs="tcp:151210:71"/> make a
man of <hi>Jobs</hi> Spirit, who would not eat his morſels alone, but invited
the fatherleſs to eat with him, <hi>Job</hi> 31.17. It will make a man love
his enemies, and do good to them that do hurt to him, <hi>Luke.</hi> 6.35. Yea
more, it will make a man lay down his life for the brethren, 1 <hi>John.</hi>
3.16. Theſe are the properties of Chriſtian Love, which will appear more or
leſs in the life of every true believer: but he that hath this worlds good,
and ſeeth his Brother in want, and yet hath no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of him, how
dwells the love of God in that man?</p>
                  <p>But in the Fifth and laſt place, Obedience to Gods will and
Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the main Duty of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9.
Chriſt is ſaid to be the Author of eternal Salvation unto all that obey
him: not unto them which continue in their rebellious wickedneſs, and never
ſubmit to be ruled by the Scepter of his word: Chriſts blood was ſhed for
ablution, as well as abſolution: as well to cleanſe from the ſoil and
filth of ſin, as to clear and free from the guilt of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi>
6.5,6. God hath choſen us in Chriſt from the Creation of the World, that we
ſhould be holy, and <pb n="16" facs="tcp:151210:72"/> without blame before him in Love,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. They therefore that never come to be Holy, never were
choſen. We are ſaid to be Created in Chriſt Ieſus unto good works,
which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them: Chriſt came
not to ſave us in our Sins, but from our ſins: to redeem unto himſelf a
peculiar people, Zealous of good works: and it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> his Commandment: <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before
men, that they may ſee your good works and glorifie your Father which is in
Heaven.</hi> Yea, the Lord hath bound it with an Oath: that whomſoever he
redeemeth out of the hands of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemies, they ſhall
worſhip him in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs all the days of their life,
<hi>Luke</hi> 1.73, &amp;c. This is that obedience which is better then
Sacrifice, and without which let none expect to be ſaved: for God hath
ſaid, <hi>VVithout Holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord: be ye therefore
holy, even as God is holy.</hi> There are many wicked men, who go on in a
continual courſe of ſin, and make no conſcience of obeying Gods Word, or
of walking in his ways: yet they <pb n="17" facs="tcp:151210:72"/> think themſelves good
Chriſtians, and doubt not of their Salvation: every drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en beaſt and
blaſpheamer thinks to go to Heaven, though none ſhall come there, nor once
ſee God without Holineſs, which they abhor.</p>
                  <p>One minds nothing but his Cups: ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nothing but his Coyn:
a third only his Curtizan: yet all theſe appoint to méet in heaven,
but this is not the way thither, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. The Luſt of the Eye,
and the pride of Life is a broad way indeed, but not to Heaven: Or, <hi>Know ye
not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>the unrighteous ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kingdom of God: be not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Adulterers, nor
Unclean perſons, nor Covetous, nor Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, nor Swearers, nor Lyars, can
claim any intereſt in the promiſe of eternal life, by Chriſt Jeſus: For
that grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, teacheth us to deny all
ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live god<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tit.</hi> 2.12. If Chriſt be not our King to govern us, be will neither be
our Prophet to forewar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, nor our
Prieſt to expiate. Except we forſake our ſins, God will never forgive
them: it cannot <pb n="18" facs="tcp:151210:73"/> conſiſt with his Iuſtice to pardon
ſuch as continue in an evil courſe of life, if Chriſt hath freed us from
the damnation of ſin, he hath alſo freed us from the dominion of ſin: if
with his blood he hath quenched the fire of Hell for us, he hath alſo
quenched the fire of Luſt in us: Chriſts Iuſtifying blood, is given by
his Sanctifying Spirit. Therefore ſuch as have no government of their
Paſſions, no conſcience of their Actions, no care of their lives:
whatever they think or pretend, they have no portion nor ſhare in the
promiſes of the Goſpel. How many that would be accounted Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and
think to go to heaven, yet in ſundry particulars fall ſhort of many wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
reprobates recorded in Scripture, who never had the hearts, upon the hearing
the threatnings of the Word, to relent, and humble themſelves with
<hi>Ahab,</hi> to confeſs their ſins, and deſire the people of God to
pray for them: with <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to be affected with joy in hearing the
Word, and practice many things: with <hi>Herod</hi> to be zealous againſt
ſin: with <hi>Jehu,</hi> willing to part with a good part of their goods:
with <hi>Ananias,</hi> to forſake the world and all their hopes in it, to
follow Chriſt as <hi>Demas</hi> 
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:151210:73" rendition="simple:additions"/> and others, to
venture their lives with <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Copper-ſmith,</hi> in
cleaving to the truth. Yea, it is ſaid of <hi>Judas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he
repented: there is Contrition: he ſaith, <hi>I have ſinned:</hi> there is
Confeſſion: and he reſtored the money again: there is Satisfaction, which
is all the Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and yet he is <hi>Judas</hi> the Son of
perdition ſtill. Now examine thy ſelf, and try whether thou doſt not come
ſhort of theſe: if ſo, it is but madneſs for thee to pleaſe thy
ſelf in a falſe conceit of thine own Happineſs. Vngodly men think God is
all mercy, yet the Word tells us he is a conſuming fire, and a jealous God:
and how can they expect he ſhould be merciful to them, who are
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nmerciful and cruel to him, to
his, and to their own ſouls? Indéed the Lord is very gracious and
ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſuch as are humble and penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who are willing
to be cleanſed from their ſins, and to put away the evil of their doings,
and abhor themſelves becauſe of their iniquities: he is exceeding merciful,
and full of compaſſion to ſuch: but to thoſe that wilfully go on in
wickedneſs follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the luſts and deſires of their own hearts, he will
not ſpeak peace to them, <pb n="20" facs="tcp:151210:74"/> but if they repent not, he will
come in flames of Fire to take vengeance upon them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore conſider this, all ye that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God, leaſt he

Matide to ſtir up our hearts unto thankfulneſs, and to knit our hearts unto
the Lord in the inſeparable bands of Love. Now to the end that all which read
or hear this Book, may know how much they ſtand engaged unto God, I ſhall
give you a taſte of his goodneſs, &amp; let you ſee what he hath done for
us, as in the firſt place he gave us our ſelves, and all the Creatures to
be our ſervants, yea be created us after his own Image, in Righteouſneſs
and Holineſs, and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of the Truth, with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to
ſtand, and for ever to continue in a moſt bleſſed and happy condition,
and this deſerves all poſſible thankfulneſs, but this was nothing in
compariſon, for when we were in a ſad condition, when we had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all
this and our ſelves, when by ſin we had turned the Image of God into the
Image of Satan, and wilfully plunged our Souls and Bodies into eternal
Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when we were become his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, mortally hating him, and to our
ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, fighting againſt him, and taking part with his enemies Sin and
Satan, not having the leaſt thought or deſire of reconcilement, but a
perverſe and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <pb facs="tcp:151210:77" rendition="simple:additions"/> will to reſiſt all means
thereunto, he did redéem us, not only without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but even
againſt our wills, ſo make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us (his curſed Enemies) ſervants of
ſervants, Sons of Sons, Heirs and Coheirs with Chriſt, here was a
fathom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs depth, a wonder beyond all wonders. But that we may the better
conſider what an alms or Boon God gave us when he gave us his Son, obſerve
that when neither Heaven nor Earth could have yeilded any ſatisfactory thing
beſides Chriſt; that could have ſatisfied Gods juſtice, and merited
heaven for us, then God in his infinite wiſdom and goodneſs did not onely
find out a way to ſatisfie his juſtice and the Law, but gave us his Son,
his only beloved Son out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and his Son gave himſelf to dye
the moſt Shameful, Painful, and Curſed death of the Croſs to
redéem us: That whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but
have everlaſting Life, <hi>John 3.16.</hi> The very thought of which death
when he came to it, together with the Weight and burthen of our ſins, put him
into ſuch an Agony in the Garden, that it made him to ſweat even Drops of
Blood, <pb facs="tcp:151210:78"/> a mercy beſtowed, and a way found out, may aſtoniſh
all the Sons of Men, and Angels in Heaven, wherefore wonder at this ye that
wonder at nothing, that the Lord ſhould come with ſuch a price to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
our worſe then loſt ſouls, and to bring Salvation unto us, even againſt
our Wills. The Lord Ieſus being rich for our ſakes became poor, that we
through his poverty might be made rich. <hi>2 Cor. 8.9.</hi> Even the eternal
God would die that we might not Dye Eternally, and that which is further
conſiderable, it coſt God more to redéem the World then to make it.
In the creation he gave us our ſelves, but in the redemption he gives us
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the creation of all things coſt him but ſix days to finiſh
it, the Redemption of Man coſt him thrée and thirty years: in the
creation of the world, he did but only ſpeak the word. In the Redemption of
Man, he both Spake, and Wept, and Swet, and Bled, and dyed; yea the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of one Sould is more and greater then the making of the whole world, but
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to illuſtrate this Love, conſider that Salvation ſtands in two
things.

Hell which we have eſcaped, for the joys of heaven which we have attained

know God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as we our ſelves are known of him, then ſhall faith be
ſwallowed up in frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then ſhall we have peace, even full without
want, pure without mixture, and perpetual without all fear of forgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:151210:81"/>What ſhall I ſay? God of his goodneſs hath
beſtowed ſo many, and ſo great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon us, that it is not
poſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his bounty therein, for if we look inward we find
our creatours merits, if we look upwards, his Mercy reacheth up into the
Heavens, if Downwards, the Earth is full of his goodneſs, and ſo is the
broad Sea, if we look about us, what is it that he hath not given us? Air to
breath in, fire to warm us, water to cleanſe and cool us, Cloaths to cover
us, Food to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh us, Fruits to refreſh us, yea delicates to pleaſe
us, Beaſts to ſerve us, Angels to attend us, Heaven to receive us, and
which is above all, himſelf, and his own Son to be enjoyed of us, ſo that
whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we turn our Eyes, we cannot look beſides his Bounty, yea we
can ſcarce think of any thing more to pray for, but that he would continue
thoſe Bleſſings which he hath beſtowed on us already, yet, we covet
ſtill as though we had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, &amp; live as if we knew nothing of his
Beneficience, we are bound to praiſe him above any Nation whatſoever, for
what Nation under Heaven enjoys ſo much <pb facs="tcp:151210:81"/> light, and ſo many
Bleſſings as we? God might have ſaid before we were formed, let them be
Loads, Monſters, Infidels, Beggars, Bond-ſlaves, Idiots, or Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo
long as they live, and after that, caſt aways for ever and ever. But he hath
made us to the beſt likeneſſe, and nurſed us in the beſt Religion,
and placed us in the beſt Land, and appointed us to the beſt and only
Inheritance, even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main with him in Bliſſe for ever: Yea thouſands
would think themſelves happy if they had but a peice of our Happineſſe,
for whereas ſome Bléed, we ſleep in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, others Beg, we
abound, others ſtarve, we are full fed, others grope in the dark, our Sun
ſtill ſhines, we have Eys, Ears, Tongues, Feet, Hands, Health, Liberty,
Reaſon, others are Blind, Deaf, Dumb, Sick, Maimed, Impriſoned, Diſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the like, yea God hath
removed ſo many evils from us, and conferred ſo many good things upon us
that they are beyond thought and imagination, for if all the World were turned
into a book, and all the Angels deputed writers therein, they could not ſet
down all the good which Gods Love in Chriſt hath done us. For <pb facs="tcp:151210:82"/>
thoſe millions of mercies which we have received ſince we were born, either
for Soul or Body, even to the leaſt bit of Bread, or ſhall to eternity (of
which we could not well want any one.) Chriſt hath purchaſed of his Father
for us, and yet God the Father alſo hath of his frée grace and mercy
given us, in giving us his ſon. Yea God is many times Working our good, when
we leaſt think upon him, as he was creating for <hi>Adam</hi> an help-meet
for him, when he was faſt aſleep, and as much do we owe God for the Dangers
from which he delivereth us, as for the great Wealth and Dignities whereunto he
hath always raiſed us.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſhall we render unto the Lord our God, ſo good
and Gracious in way of Thankfullneſſe, for all theſe his Merits. The
Contribution of Bleſſings require Retribution of Thanks, or will bring
diſtribution of Plagues, neither could we poſſibly be unthankful, if we
ſeriouſly thought upon what God gives, and what he forgives, for in
Reaſon hath he contrived ſo many ways to ſave us, and ſhould not we
take all occaſions to glorifie him? hath he done ſo much for us, 
<pb facs="tcp:151210:82"/> and ſhall we deny him any thing that he requires of us? though
it were our lives, yea our Souls, much more our Luſts: we have exceeding hard
hearts, if the Blood of the Lamb cannot ſoften them; ſtony Bowels, if ſo
many Mercies can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not melt them, was Chriſt Crucified for our Sins, and
ſhould we by our ſins cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him again? Oh let the meditation of what
God and Chriſt hath one for us, make us do what we are able for him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
for did Chriſt do all this for us, and ſhall we do nothing for him? like
favours require like gratitude. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was a great Sinner, and
ſhe had much forgiven her, therefore ſhe loved much, ſo ſhould every
one of us do likewiſe, wherefore if we have any ingenuity in us, it will make
us direct all our thoughts ſpeeches and actions to Gods glory, as he hath
directed our Eternal Salvation thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But to help and further you herein, if you be willing ſo to
do, take theſe few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Let theſe things be never out of the Minds,
memories, and Mouths of thoſe whom Chriſt hath done thus for, <pb facs="tcp:151210:83"/>
let every one of us, ſay with Holy <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard: Lord if I owed my whole
ſelf unto thee, forgiving me my ſelf in my Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what have I left to
pay for giving thy ſelf for me to ſo cruel a Death, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my
Redemption? which was not ſo cheap as my creation, great was the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
that thou wouldeſt Create me of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what tongue can ſufficiently
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the greatneſs of the grace that thou didſt redeem me with ſo
dear a price when I was worſe then nothing, we are full of thy goodneſs: O!
let our Hearts run o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with Thankfulneſs:</hi> and let us ſay with
<hi>David; O Lord what is Man that thou art ſo mindful of him? What ſhall I
render unto thee O Lord for all theſe thy Benefits, but Love thee my Creatour
and Redeemer and become a new Creature.</hi> How can any Rational Man meditate
on ſuch unbottomed a Love, and not ſtudy and ſtrive for an anſwerably,
thankful, demeanour? if a friend had given us but the thouſandth part of what
he hath, we ſhould heartily love him all our lives, and think no thanks
ſufficient: what price then ſhould we ſet upon Ieſus Chriſt, who is
the life of our lives, and the Soul of <pb facs="tcp:151210:83"/> our Souls: Surely this
ſhould at leaſt make us part with our neareſt, deareſt, and
ſweeteſt darling Sins to ſerve him in Righteouſneſſe, and
Holineſſe, every Day, every Hour, all the Days of our Lives, what a
Brutiſh and Barbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unthankfulneſſe and ſhame, were it that God
ſhould part with his Son, and his Son with his own precious blood for us, and
we not part with our ſinful Luſts and Delights for him.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, Hath Chriſt done all this for us his Servants?
ſo much, and ſo many ways obliged to him, then let us do what we are able
for him again.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us be zealous for his Glory, and take his part
when we ſee or hear him diſhonoured, for as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith,
<hi>There can be no Love where there is no Zeal.</hi> Well Born Children are
touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Quick with the Injuries of their Parents. And it is a baſe
Vile and unjuſt Ingratitude that can endure the diſgrace of them under
whoſe ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they live.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb facs="tcp:151210:84"/>2. Let us ſeek to draw others after us
from Satan unto him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do we all we can to promote his Worſhip and
Service.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Take all good occaſions to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to others how
good God is, and what he hath done for us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Let us wholy aſcribe all the good we have, or do to
free Grace, and give him the Glory of his Gifts, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to our
Maſters beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Let us (that we may expreſſe our
Thankfullneſſe unto him) ſhew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to his Children and poor
Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who are Bone of his Bone, and Fleſh of his Fleſh.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Abhor we our ſelves, for our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
unthankfulneſſe, and our wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful provoking of him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Hearken we unto Chriſts Voice <pb facs="tcp:151210:84"/> in all
that he ſaith unto us, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe our Thankfullneſſe by our
Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Yea all this let us do, if we do it but for our own Sakes, for what
ſhould we have if we did thus ſerve Chriſt who hath done all theſe
things for his Enemies, neglecting and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him. 'Tis true we cannot
properly be ſaid to do any thing for him, that have all we have from him, or
if we could give him our Bodies and Souls, they would be ſaved by it, but he
were never the better for them, yet we may do theſe and the like things,
which he accounts and rewards as done to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe things we ought to do, thus thankful we ought to
be to God, for his ineſtimable and unſpeakable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits towards us. But do
we thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite the Lord? or do we what we are able for him again. O that I
could ſay we did, yea I would we were but ſo thankful to Chriſt for all
his Mercies (the leaſt whereof is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then all the Courteſies of Men)
as we are to a friend for ſome one good turn. But Wo worth us a people not
worthy <pb facs="tcp:151210:85"/> the Crumbs of Chriſt, and our Maſters leaſt Mercy,
yea well worthy of more Plagues, then either <hi>Tyre</hi> or <hi>Sidon;
Sodom</hi> or <hi>Gomarah,</hi> or any People ſince the Creation, for as if
all that Chriſt hath done for us, were nothing to move us, we are ſo far
from being thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, from loving, and ſerving him, that did we ſeriouſly
think of Chriſts love, and our odious unthankfullneſſe, and compare Gods
goodneſſe with our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, rightly, weighing how we have from time to
time abuſed his Mercy, and thoſe many means of grace which he in his
long-ſuffering hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded for our reclaiming, it would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven make us
Speechleſſe like him in the Goſpel, as neither expecting par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, nor
daring to ask it; yea it is the unſpeakable Mercy of the Lord, that our Land
hath not long ſince Spued us out, and that we are not at this preſent
frying in Hell, for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God hath removed ſo many evils Spiritual and
Corporal; Temporal and Eternal from us, and conferred ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good things
upon us that they are beyond Thought and Imagination, we <pb facs="tcp:151210:85"/> have
ſtriven to multiply offences againſt him, and to make them as infinite in
Number as his Bleſſings, we have done nothing from our Infancy, but added
Sin for Sin, as he hath added Mercy to Mercy, whereby our Sins are become for
Number as the Sands of the Sea, and as the Stars of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, may not God
juſtly another day call heaven and earth to witneſſe againſt us, that
he would have ſav'd us, yea, did woe us to accept of Salvation, ſaying:
<hi>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will you Dye O People of <hi>England:</hi>
                     </hi>
But we would not be Converted nor Saved, for whereas God hath offered us a
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don (in rendering Chriſt unto us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Condition of Faith and
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) even his own Son, to be a means of our Reconciliation, we are ſo
far from accepting it thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, that we not onely Refuſe and Contemn it,
but in a manner derided the offer of it our ſelves, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Goſpel of
glad Tydings, and perſecute Chriſt in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, either with Hand or
Tongue, or both, we are (moſt of us) ſo <pb facs="tcp:151210:86"/> far from being Holy
our ſelves, that we hate Holineſſe in others, for if any become Religious
and Conſcientious, and will not for Company grievouſly Sin againſt God,
Wrong their Bodies, deſtroy their own Souls, and Willfully leap into Hell
Fire with us? we Envy, Hate, Cenſure, Scoff at, Nick-Name, Rail on and
ſlander them, that we may Diſcourage them in the Way to Heaven, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffle
them out and make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their Holy profeſſion, and Religious
Converſation, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently pull them back to the World, that ſo
we may have their Company here in Sin, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in Torment: Oh fooliſh
Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and unwiſe thus to requite the Lord: Our horrid Sins are grown up
unto Heaven, in regard whereof we may juſtly be confounded and aſhamed to
lift up our Eyes to him who is a Lord, ſo great and terrible, of ſuch
Glorious Majeſty and Infinite Purity, what then ſhall we ſay to theſe
things. Is there any Hope left for ſuch Vile <pb facs="tcp:151210:86"/> Creatures as we

Loving, Honouring, and obeying him, there is no queſtion but God will

make for their good, that both their perſons &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances ſhall be
good &amp; acceptable, which before were vile and abominable. That by the
prayer of Faith they ſhall obtain of God whatſoever they ſhal ask in
Chriſts Name, and according to his Word: and in fine, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good things
that can be named, whether Temporal, or Spiritual, or Eternal, are by the
promiſe of God entayled upon them that love him and keep his Commandments,
nor need we wonder at this, or once queſtion the ſame, for if he ſpared
not his own Son; but delivered him to death for us, how ſhall he not with him
freely give us all things alſo, <hi>Rom. 8.31,32.</hi> It is the Apoſtles
argument; great, yea too great things for us to receive, but not too great, for
the great and good God of Heaven and Earth to give, all the fear is on our
part, whether we be ſuch to whom the promiſe is made, for all Gods
promiſes are conditional, and though of theſe outward good things he hath
promiſed abundance, yet it is upon the condition of faith &amp; obedience, as
appears by the afore mentioned pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that if we be not wanting in our
duty &amp; obedience to God, God would not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any good thing to us,
nor can we lock <pb facs="tcp:151210:91"/> that God ſhould make good his promiſes, if we
make them void by not obſerving the condition, if we will not dare to truſt
God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his promiſe ſo confidently, as we would a Friend or ſome great
Man that is able and honeſt: Beſides the Lord hath promiſed that there
ſhall be no want to them y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fear him, &amp; no good thing will he with-hold
from them that walk uprightly, <hi>Pſal. 34.9,</hi> and <hi>84,11.</hi> Where
obſerve two things, there ſhall be no want to ſuch, and ſuch ſhall
want no good thing, ſo that he muſt be ſuch a one to whom the promiſe
is made, and he muſt alſo be ſure that it is good for him which is
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; but oftentimes it is not good for a man to abound with earthly
Bleſſings, as ſtrong Drink is not good for weak Brains, yea if any thing
be wanting to a good man, he may be ſure 'tis not good for him, and then
better that he doth want it, than that he did enjoy it. And what wiſe man
will complain of the want of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which if he had, would prove more hurtful than
gainful to him, as a Sword to a Mad-man, a knife to a Child, drink to them that
have a Feavor or the Drop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>e. No
good thing will God with-hold, &amp;c. And therefore not wants themſelves,
which to many are alſo good, yea very good things, as I could reckon up many
want, ſanctified is a notable <pb facs="tcp:151210:92"/> means to bring to repentance to
work in us amendment of Life, it ſtirs up to prayer, it weans from the love
of the World, it keeps us always prepared for the ſpiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
diſcovers whether we be true believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or Hypocrites, prevents greater evils
of ſin and puniſhments to come, it makes us humble, comfortable to Chriſt
our head, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth our faith, our joy, our thankfulneſſe our
ſpiritual wiſdome, and likewiſe our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, as I have ſhown at large
in another Book cal'd the <hi>Chriſtians Comfort.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, all good
things were created for the good, and therefore they are called goods
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the good created them, for good men to do good withal. Therefore as
<hi>Jacob</hi> got the bleſſing, ſo he got y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> inheritance alſo, to
ſhew that as the faithful have y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inward bleſſing, ſo they have the
outward bleſſing too; when they will do them good, and cauſe them to do
good, yea in this caſe even as the ſheafs fell before <hi>Ruth,</hi> ſo
the Kiches ſhall fall in our way, as they did to <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> upon
whom rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were caſt, they knew not how, but as if God had onely ſaid, be
rich, and they were Rich ſtraight, but that this is the true and onely way to
Wealth and Happineſſe néeds no more proof then that which is
recorded of <pb facs="tcp:151210:92"/> 
                     <hi>Solomon, 1 Kings 3. 2 Chron. 1.</hi> Where the
Lord appearing to him in a dream ſaid,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>k what I ſhall give thee, and
he asking onely an underſtanding Heart to diſcern between good and evil,
that he might the better Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge that great place whereunto God had called
him, wherein Gods glory and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples good were his Principal Aim and end:
hear what the Lords Anſwer is: <hi>Becauſe this was in thine heart, and
thou haſt not ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Riches, Wealth, or Honour; nor the life of thine enemies
neither, yet haſt asked long life but haſt asked Wiſdome and Knowledge
for thy ſelf, that thou mighteſt judge my people, over whom I have made
thee King, Wiſdome and Knowledge is Granted unto thee, and I will give thee
Riches, and Wealth, and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſuch as none of the Kings have had that have
been before thee: neither ſhall there any after thee have the like.</hi> Yea
he was ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing rich that he gave Silver in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
as ſtones, <hi>1 Kings 10.27.</hi> Loe the true way to Wealth, Honour, and
Happineſſe is to deſire Grace that we may glorifie God, and do good: For
clearing whereof I'le give you a Similitude. A Man ſpies a fair Apple on a
Tree, hath a longing deſire unto it, whereupon he falls a ſhaking the
Trée with all his might, at length it not onely comes <pb facs="tcp:151210:93"/> down
but many other come down to him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it, and ſo much to prove that
the way to become rich is firſt to become God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He that would be a Rich Man let him be a
merciful Man, and do good with what God hath already given him, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo little, for there is not a more ſure and Infallible way to Increaſe
and Multiply a mans outward eſtate, then in being charit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poor, if
we will believe Gods word, as what ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Give and it ſhall
be given unto you,</hi> Good Meaſure preſſed down and ſhaken together
and running over ſhall men give into your Boſome, <hi>Luk. 6.38. Mat. 7.2.
Mark 4.14.</hi> And to this accord that place in the <hi>Proverbs.</hi> There
is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth and is more encreaſed, but he that ſpareth more then
is right, ſhall ſurely come to poverty. The liberal perſon ſhall have
plenty, and he that watereth ſhall alſo have rain, <hi>Pro. 11.24,25.</hi>
And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Pſalms;</hi> Wealth and Riches ſhall be in the
houſe of him that hath compaſſion of and giveth to the poor, <hi>Pſal.
112.3,</hi> to <hi>10.</hi> See here how bounty is the beſt and ſureſt
way to Plenty. But notable to this purpoſe is that, <hi>Pro. 28.37. He that
giveth to the poor ſhall not lack, a rare and incomparable priviledge never
to <pb facs="tcp:151210:93"/> want,</hi> and yet this is a bargain of Gods own making,
plenty ſhall furniſh the table where Charity takes away and gives to the
Poor. He hath diſperſed abroad ſaith the Pſalmiſt and given to the
poor, his Benevolence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for ever, <hi>Pſal. 112.9.</hi> He hath
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to give that hath a free and bountiful Heart to give, ſaith St.
<hi>Bernard,</hi> and of this the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> doth aſſure us.
The libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral man ſaith he deviſeth liberal things, and by liberality he
ſhall ſtand, <hi>Iſa. 32.8.</hi> A man would think he ſhould rather
fall by being ſo liberal &amp; bountiful, but this is the beſt courſe to
thrive &amp; hold out. Nor was it ever known that God ſuffered a merciful and
a bountiful man to want, ordering his affairs with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, <hi>Pſal.
112.5.</hi> But you have not heard a Tith of theſe promiſes, for the
Scriptures no leſs abound in them, than ſilver did in the days of
<hi>Solomon,</hi> of which only a few more, is what ſaith the wiſe man,
<hi>Pro. 3. Honour the Lord with thy ſubſtance, &amp; with the firſt
fruits of all thine encreaſe, ſo ſhall thy barns be filled with
abundance, and thy preſſes ſhall burſt with new Wine,</hi> in which
regard that which is this way expended, may be likened to thoſe loves and

ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Old or New Teſtament be true, not getting but giving is the true
&amp; ready way to abundance, that to give in this caſe is the way to have,
and that we are the richer for diſourſting, which makes
<hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> ſay: That the gainfuleſt art is Alms giving, and
hence it is that the Scripture compares it to ſowing of Seed, <hi>2 Cor.
9.6.</hi> He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly, but he that
ſoweth bountifully ſhal alſo reap bountifully, the Apoſtle compares
giving to ſowing, to note unto us the great gain and advantage that commeth
thereby, and the Scriptures likewiſe compareth it to lending or putting money
to intereſt, <hi>Pro. 19.17. He that hath pitty on the poor lendeth unto the
Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> The Lord is
content to acknowledge himſelf the charitable Mans debter, yea by our
liberality to the poor, our moſt gracious redeemer acknowledgeth his ſelf
gratified &amp; engaged, <hi>Math. 25.35,36, &amp;c.</hi> And for as much as ye
did it to the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me, the poor
mans Hand is Chriſts Treaſury or Bank; and by putting thereinto a man
becomes a <pb facs="tcp:151210:94"/> Creditour to his Savior, neither will he pay or
recompence us as we do our Creditours, for as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> well notes,
what we receive by way of return, is not ten for an hundred, nor an hundred for
ten, but an hundred for one, yea a thouſand thouſand for one, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

together with a Kingdome, even an immortal, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Kingdome of Glory and

&amp; your ſouls, would you be rich indeed, and that both here and hereafter,
then be charitable to the poor, even to the utmoſt of your Ability; for this
giving is not onely an act of Charity, but of Chriſtian policy, ſince we

Bounty and Liberality to the poor.</p>
                  <p>The Third and Fourth are thankfullneſſe and humility,

                  <p>Thankfulneſſe and Humility are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means to enrich
us with Gods bleſſings, but Pride and Vnthankfulneſſe is the onely way
to make God withdraw, and take from us both himſelf and his Bleſſings:

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixtly,</hi> If thou wouldſt grow rich, then be frugul
and thrifty in ſpending, for Thrift which is a due ſaving from
néedleſſe and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expences, and a wary huſbanding of what we
get, hath made as many Rich Men as painful getting. It is our Saviours rule
ſo to diſpoſe of that plenty which God in his goodneſſe beſtowed
upon us, that nothing be loſt, <hi>John 6.12.</hi> And it is a rule which all
good men will be ſure to obſerve, for he who gets what he hath juſtly
pays what he owes duly; requites favours, receiv'd thankfully, conſiders the
caſe of the poor cordially; will not, yea dare not ſpend waſtfully, let
means come in never ſo plentifully, and yet he of all men is ſure of a
laſting Competency, <hi>Prov. 28.27.</hi> Frugality ſaith
<hi>Juſtine</hi> is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Vertues, but an expenſive Man
whatſoever his getting be by waſting and overlaſhing of his eſtate, is
ſure not to thrive as it fared with that Captain in <hi>Tully,</hi> who was
not a penny the richer for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> huge ſum of Money given him, becauſe he had
done with it as a naked man would do with the nuts, <pb facs="tcp:151210:99"/> he gathers,
carry them all away in his belly, for lack of pockets: to want and waſt
differ: but in time a poor man hath riches, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal ſhall have none, the
veſſel that runneth out unduly, will be empty when men come to draw out of
it, ſo will the ſtate be if we let it leak like a Crackt Veſſel. But
what the difference is betwixt a wiſe &amp; prudent fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, and a vain
expence of Gods benefits, we may learn from, <hi>Gen. 42. &amp;c.</hi> Where
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>7</hi> years of Famine, <hi>Aegypt</hi> had Corn
enough when all other Countries were without, &amp; the people ready to
Famiſh, which needed not have béen if they had béen more
ſparing in the 7 plentiful years, for thoſe years of plenty were not
confined to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> other Countries adjoyned were no leſſe
fruitful, as the learned aver. But that prodigality brings many rich men to
pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, &amp; poor men to Beggery, daily experience do abundantly Teſtifie.
Therefore if thou wouldſt be rich waſt not any part of thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
in vain néedleſſe ſuperfluous expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but beg of God wiſdome
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou mayſt improve his bleſſings to the beſt advantage y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo he
may be glorifi'd, &amp; thy ſtore encreaſed. Then ſhalt thou live happily
and contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all thy days. And ſo much of the means how of poor to become
rich. Conſider what hath been ſaid, and the Lord give you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
in all things.</p>

light in the underſtanding, whereby the poor ſoul may ſée his

                        <item> 2. That he was made a Compendium, and Abridgement of

                  <p>More eſpecially we are to know, that as God made all things
elſe for Man's uſe and ſervice, ſo he Created Man, Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,
more immediately for his own Honour, and Service, and did accordingly adorn him
with Gifts and Abilities above all other viſible Creatures, for God made us,
had not we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made our ſelves, after his own Image, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with
perfection of all true Wiſdom, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Righteouſneſs, writing
his Law in our hearts, and giving us ability to obey and fulfil the ſame in
every point, and withal, a power to ſtand, and for ever to continue in a
moſt <pb n="5" facs="tcp:151210:101"/> bleſſed, and happy condition, frée from
all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and to enjoy a ſwéet and bleſſed Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, with
his Creator, ſo that man was created very good, did clearly and perfectly
know the whole Will and Works of his Maker, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble out of the integrity of
his Soul, and fitneſs of all the powers, fully, willingly, and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
to love, obſerve, and obey his Maker in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very tittle and circumſtance he
required, and to love his Neighbour as himſelf; ſo that neither the mind
did conceive, nor the heart deſire, nor the body put in execution any thing,
but that which was acceptable, and well-pleaſing unto God, as theſe
enſuing Scriptures doth plainly prove, <hi>Gen. 1.26,27,30. Eccleſ. 7.29.
Rom. 2.14,15.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, to ſhew you how man came to be
corrupted.</p>
                  <p>God at firſt entred into Covenant with our firſt Parents,
as publique Perſons, both in behalf of themſelves, and all that ſhould
proceed out of their Loyns, and ſo that whatſoever Gifts, Priviledges, and
Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they had beſtowed upon them, ſhould be continued to them and
theirs, onely upon condition of their Loyalty and perſonal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (of
which the tree of life was a pledge) and they ſhould have, and enjoy them, or
loſe, and be deprived of them, as well for their off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:151210:102"/> as for themſelves; as they ſhould keep or
tranſgreſs his Royal Law. But ſee how unworthily they demeaned
themſelves towards their Bountiful Maker and Benefactor, for whereas God
placed them in Paradiſe, and gave them frée liberty to eat of the
fruit of every trée of the Garden, ſave only of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of good &amp; evil, prohibiting them that alone, even upon pain of eternal
death to them &amp; theirs, they moſt perſidiouſly contemned and brake
this Law, which (as ſundry circumſtances that do agravate it, ſhew) was a
moſt execrable and damnable Sin; as obſerve the ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
ſet down by <hi>Moſes</hi> to amplifie the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their fall:
As,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That they deſpiſed and made light of the
promiſe of God, whereby they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to hope for everlaſting life,
ſo long as they continued their Loyalty and Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There was in it an unſufferable pride and
ambition, in that he could not content himſelf with being Lord of the whole
Vniverſe, but he muſt be equal unto God, and every way like his Maker.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What greater unbelief could there be? when he gave
more credit to the Serpent, in ſaying he ſhould not dye, then to God, who
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before tells him, that if he did eat the forbidden fruit, he
ſhould ſurely dye.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:151210:102"/>Fourthly, In this ſin was not only
unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not to be paralel'd, but withal, Murder of himſelf and all his
poſterity, who he knew were to ſtand or fall with him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Herein was foul Apoſtacy from God, to the Devil, to
whom (in effect) charging God with Lying, Envy, Malice, &amp;c. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
and adheared, rather then ſtick to his Maker. And to theſe might be added
many the like circumſtances, which exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the Sin of our
firſt Parents, and make it ſo deadly in effect; for hereby it is we not
onely loſt our bleſſed Communion with God, that the Image of God after
which they were created, was forthwith aboliſhed, and blotted out, but that
many grievous Miſeries, and Puniſhments came in the room of it; ſo that
in the place of Wiſdom, Power, Holineſs, Truth, Righteouſneſs, and the
like: Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith we had been cloathed, there hath ſucceded theſe,
and the like. This their Sin hath filled our whole man with Corruption; it hath
made us become Vaſſals unto Sin, and Satan, it hath diſabled us from
underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will, and obſerving the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Lord, it
caus'd us to loſe our right unto, and Soveraignty over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it
makes our perſons and actions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to God, it hath caſt us out of
God's <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151210:103"/> favour, and made us liable, and ſubject to all the
plagues and miſeries of this life, and to endleſs, eaſeleſs, and
remedileſs Torments in the World to come. And the reaſon is, our firſt
Parents, being the Root of all Mankind, and inſtead of all their poſterity
before they had Iſſue; and the Covenant being made with them as publique
perſons, not for themſelves onely, but for their poſterity, who were to
ſtand or fall with them, they being left to the freedom of their own Wills,
in Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Commandment of God, by eating the Forbidden-Fruit,
through the Temptation of Satan, have made us and all Mankind de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
from them by ordinary Generation, as guilty of their Sin, as any Heir is liable
to Fathers Debt, their act being ours, as the act of a Knight or Burgeſs in
the Parliament-Houſe, is the act of the whole County, in whoſe name and
room they ſit, and whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, by which means our Nature is ſo
corrupted, that we are utterly indiſpoſed, and made opoſite to all that
is ſpiritually good, and wholy inclined to all evil, and that continually,
and have alſo loſt our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, incurred his diſpleaſure
and Curſe, ſo as we are juſtly liable to all puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both in this
life, and that which is to come, for the confirmation of this point, theſe 
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:151210:103"/> following Scriptures, amongſt many others, are the

came to ſave or once to call thée that haſt no ſin, but art

righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ſéeſt thy ſelf the greateſt of

ſpeak, or do; and that thy very righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is no beter then
menſtruous cloath, thou canſt have no part in Chriſt, and until Chriſt
ſhall become thine by regeneration and a lively faith, thou art bound to
kéep the whole Law actually and ſpiritually, with thy whole man, thy
whole life, or elſe ſuffer eternal death &amp; deſtruction of ſoul and
body in hell, for not kéeping it. But this being a main fundamental
point, which every man is bound to know, I will more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fully
explain it, as thus. Man being in a moſt miſerable and undone condition, by
reaſon of Original and Actual Sin, and of the Curſe due to both, being
liable to all miſeries in this life, and adjudged to ſuffer Eternal
Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Hell after Death, having no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to eſcape the
fierce Wrath of Almighty <pb n="17" facs="tcp:151210:107"/> God, who had already pronounced
Sentence upon him, when neither Heaven nor Earth could have yeilded any
ſatisfactory thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Chriſt, that could have ſatisfied God's
juſtice, and merited Heaven for us.</p>
                  <p>Then, O then, God of his infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, did
not only find out a way to ſatisfie his Iuſtice, and the Law, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
gave us his own Son out of his boſom, and his Son gave himſelf to dye, even
the moſt ſhameful, painful, and curſed death of the Croſs, to
redéem us, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him ſhould not periſh, but
have everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life. Which Salvation ſtands in two things. Firſt, in
freeing and delivering us from Hell. Secondly, in the poſſeſſion of
Heaven and eternal Life. Chriſt by his death merits the firſt for us, and
by his obedience fulfilling the Law, merits the ſecond. Hear this all you
that care to be ſaved, God will pardon all your Sins, he will give you an
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Crown of Glory in Heaven, if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly repent, and wholly rely
upon Chriſt for your Salvation, by a lively Faith, and that becauſe he is
juſt, for although the Lord can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in juſtice let ſin go unpuniſhed,
for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin is eternal death, <hi>Rom. 6.23.</hi> Death in the
perſon, if not in the ſurety, yet Chriſt hath ſufficiently ſatisfied
for all the ſins of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and paid their debt even to the utmoſt
far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <pb n="18" facs="tcp:151210:108"/> as is evident by, <hi>Iſa. 53.4,5. 2 Cor.
5.21. Heb. 9.29. 1 Pet. 2.24. Rom. 3.25,26.</hi> And ſundry other places: as
we are bound to perform perfect obedience to the Law: Chriſt performed it for
us: were we for diſobedience ſubject to the ſentence of condemation, the
curſe of the Law, and death of body and ſoul? he was condemned for us, and
bore the curſe of the Law, he dyed in our ſtead an ignominious death: did
he deſerve the anger of God? he endured his fathers wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
diſpleaſure, that he might reconcile us to his Father, and ſet us at
liberty; therefore was the Son of God made the Son of Man, that the Sons of Men
might be made the Sons of God.</p>
                  <p>And ſo much for explication of the 3 Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples mentioned
in the beginning. But now comes the hardeſt part of my Work to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;
for admit the natural man be convinced of the truth of theſe thrée
fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples never ſo clearly, yet he will draw ſuch a
concluſion from the promiſes, that he will never be the better for what
hath been told him, yea, he will deceit all, even the mercy and goodneſs of
God into poyſon, for what will ſuch a one ſuggeſt to himſelf, the
Devil helping forward? Let it be granted, will he ſay that I were every way
wretched and miſerable, a great ſinner, both ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally and actually, and
likewiſe liable to all the plagues of this life, and of that to come, yet I I
thank God I am well enough, ſo long as Chriſt <pb n="19" facs="tcp:151210:108"/> hath
paid my ranſom, and fréed me from all, by a new Covenant, the Tenure
whereof is, <hi>Believe and Live;</hi> whereas at firſt it was, <hi>Do this

large and precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, yet there are none ſo general, which are not
limited with the condition of faith, and the fruit thereof, unfeigned
repentance, and each of them are ſo entailed, that none can lay claim to them
but true believers, which repent and turn from all their ſins to ſerve him

                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:151210:109"/> mean well, they repent of their Sins, have as good
wiſhes and deſires as can be, are Elected, hope to go to Heaven as well as
the beſt. But to every of theſe I will anſwer: Firſt, True faith
purifieth the heart, and worketh by Love, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth our corruptions, and
ſanctifieth the whole man throughout, ſo that our faith to God, is
ſéen by our faithfulneſs to men; our inviſible belief, by our
viſible life; Faith and Holineſs are as inſeperable as Life and Motion,
the Sun and Light, Fire and Heat, Honey and Swéet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Again, Faith
believeth the threats of the Word, as well as the promiſes. Now thou who
pretendeſt Faith in the promiſes, ſhew me thy belief in the Threatnings;
for didſt thou believe the truth of theſe Menaces which God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt Vnclean, Covetous, Ambitious, Vnjuſt, Envious, Malicious Perſons,
and ſuch like Sinners; how durſt thou then wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>low in theſe Sins, that if God inſtead of Hell, had
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Heaven as a reward, thou couldſt not do more then thou doſt,
why ſhouldeſt thou deceive thy ſelf with an opinion of Faith, when indeed
thou believeſt not ſo much as the Devil does, for he believes, namely the
threatnings of the Word, and trembles for horror, <hi>Jam. 2.19.</hi> Again,
Faith is wrought by God's Spirit, and where it is wrought, it brings forth the
fruits of the Spirit, mentioned <hi>Gal. 5.22,23.</hi> Whereas preſumption,
as it is of the fleſh, ſo it brings forth <pb n="22" facs="tcp:151210:110"/> the fruits
of the Fleſh, <hi>v. 19,20,21.</hi> Now this is a ſure Rule, the
perſwaſion onely which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſound Humiliation, is Faith; that which
goes before it, is Preſumption; for no man can repent of Sin, but he that
believeth the pardon of Sin; for none can believe his Sins are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
except he hath repented.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for their good hearts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, they may
think what they will, but every wiſe man knows that the outward acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
declare the inward intentions. A good Converſion is proved by a good
Converſation; and in caſe the hearts of ſuch men could be ſéen
by others, as their works and words are, their hearts would appear worſt of
all; as they do to God, who ſéeth them: nor is any evil in the mouth
or hand, which was not in the heart firſt of all; as the ſtream in the
Fountain; the heart of Man is deceitful above all things, and whilſt they
think there is no deceit in it, even in that they are moſt of all
deceived.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Touching their Repentance, my Anſwer is: True
Repentance for Sin, is a turning from every Sin, to the contrary Good. True
Repentance is a change both in the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from Errour, to Truth, and in the
Will, from Evil, to Good, and in the Affections, from loving Evil, and hateing
Good, to love Good, and hate Evil, in the whole man, from Darkneſs, to Light,
and from the power of Satan to God, <pb n="23" facs="tcp:151210:110"/> without which change,
no repentance, no being ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As for their aſſurance of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is upon
as good ground as all the reſt, for they ſlumber, and ſuppoſe
themſelves good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, their Faith is but a dream, their hope but a
dream, their charity but a dream, their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but a dream, their whole
Religion but a dream, and ſo their aſſurance of ſalvation is but a
dream, they have regeneration in conceit, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and righteouſneſs in
conceit, they ſerve God well in conceit, do the works of juſtice and

none that have eyes in their heads, and open, can be ſo ſottiſh; but Sin
is like the juyce of Poppy, which if the quantity excéed, bringeth the

might cauſe man to turn away from his enterprize, and that he might

<hi>Benhadads</hi> Counſellours, that ſent him with a Cord about his Neck

hath whipt many a Soul to Heaven, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Proſperity had couched

pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileſſe Naballs which refuſed to fill his Belly with the Husks of the
Swine: and indeed ſeldome is any Man awakened from the ſleep of Sin but by
Affliction: for as Aloes kills worms in the ſtomach, or as Froſt and Cold
deſtroys Vermin, ſo doth bitter Afflictions crawling Luſts in the Heart:
my wants ſaith one kills my Wantonneſſe, my Poverty checks <pb facs="tcp:151210:113"/>
my Pride, my being ſlighted quells my Ambition and vain Glory, and as for
Sickneſſe it cuts the Throat of Vices; yea how many will confeſſe that
one Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction hath done more good upon them, then many Sermons that they have
Learned, more good in one Days or Weeks miſery, than many years Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
could teach them: Repentance ſeldome méets a man in jollity, but in
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction the Heart is made plyable and ready for all good Impreſſions.
True, if Gentleneſſe would ſerve, we ſhould not ſmart, for God like a
good Chirurgeon firſt ſtrokes the Arm before he opens the Vein. He ſends
for us by his Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours the Miniſtry, yet we come not. Let him fire
our field, as <hi>Abſolom</hi> did by <hi>Joab,</hi> we come preſently:

have hard wedges, ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſtrong afflictions, great
corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, great Calamities to cure them. Affliction is but the Shepheards
Dog to fetch us into Chriſts Fold, perhaps by Barking onely, and then we are
more ſcared then hurt, perhaps in his Mouth, and the poor Sheep thinks
ſurely he will worry it, but he is taught to fetch onely, <pb facs="tcp:151210:114"/> and
therefore gripes not, but only carrys it, and delivers it to his Maſter, when

Aſhes upon their Heads, as thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be as far under ground
as they were now above it. An Humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is the onely way to
diſarm Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and be rid of his Rod. <hi>1 Pet. 5.6.</hi> Sin
bringeth judgement, and only judgement preventeth it, thy Sin hath kindled the
fire of Gods Wrath, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repentance is as Water to quench this fire. King

be throughly ſatisfied, yea grow thou better by it, and God will love thee

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for the preſent ſeems to be joyous, but grievous. But
afterwards it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the quiet fruits of Righteouſneſſe to them that
are thereby exerciſed, <hi>Heb. 12.11.</hi> God beats us that he may better
us, he hedgeth us about with Thorns that he may keep us within Compaſſe,
leſt we break over into Satans Paſture, which indeed would but fat us for
the ſlaughter. God ſtrips the Body of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure <pb facs="tcp:151210:115" rendition="simple:additions"/> to
cloath the Soul with Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and oftentimes ſtrengthen our
ſtate of Grace by Impoveriſhing our Temporal eſtate, for commonly the
more Proſperity the leſſe Piety. The Poor ſaith Chriſt receive the
Goſpel, though the Rich are more bound. Few men can digeſt great felicity,
many a Man hath been a looſer by his gains, and that that which multiplyed
his outward eſtate hath abated his inward, and ſo on the contrary
<hi>David</hi> was never ſo tender as when he was hunted like a patridge,
<hi>1 Sam. 26.20. Jonah</hi> was at beſt in the Whales Belly:
<hi>Stevens</hi> face never ſhone ſo fair as when he ſtood before the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, <hi>Acts 6.15.</hi> Now if the Winter of the one is found to be the
ſpring of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Corruption of Proſperity the Generation of
Piety, who will eſtéem thoſe things good which make us worſe, or
that evil which brings ſuch gain and ſweetneſſe? Before I was
afflicted, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> I went aſtray, but now I keep thy
Commandment, <hi>Pſal. 119.67.</hi> Theſe evils do preſs us, but it is to
God and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, yea how much lower our Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions weigh us down on
Earth, ſo much the more earneſtly our affections mount <pb facs="tcp:151210:116"/> up to
Heaven. Devotion like fire in froſty weather burns hoteſt in Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
When the Waters of the flood came upon the face of the Earth, down went
ſtately Turrets and Towers, but as the waters roſe, the Ark roſe ſtill
higher and higher, in like ſort when the waters of affliction ariſe, down
goes the Pride of Life, the Luſt of the Eyes: in a word, all the vanities of
the world, but the Ark of the Soul ariſeth as theſe waters riſe, and that
higher even neerer and neerer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven. Oh! admirable uſe of
Afflictions, Health from a wound, cure from a diſeaſe, out of greif joy,
gain out of loſſe, out of Infirmity ſtrength, out of ſin,
Holineſſe: out of death Life, yea we ſhall redéem ſomething of
Gods diſhonour by ſin, if we ſhall thence grow more Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They ſerve to quicken our Devotion, and
make us pray unto God with more fervency: Lord ſaith <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> in
trouble they will viſit thee, they poured out prayers when thy chaſtning
was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, <hi>Iſa. 26.16.</hi> In their affliction ſaith
<hi>Hoſea</hi> they will ſéek thée diligently, <hi>Hoſ.
5.15.</hi> That we never pray ſo féel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, fervently, forcibly as in
time of <pb facs="tcp:151210:116"/> affliction, may be ſeen in the examples of the
Children of <hi>Iſrael, Judges 3.9,15. Eliſha, 2 Kings 6.18. Hezekiah, 2
Kings 19.15,16.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, <hi>Jehoſophat,</hi> who being told that there
was a great multitude com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt him from beyond y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sea, out of

<hi>Judea,</hi> yea they came out of all parts and joyn'd with him to enquire
of the Lord, <hi>2 Chron. 20.3,4.</hi> Neither doth it make us alone, which
ſuffer, earneſt in Prayer, but it makes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo labour in prayer to
God for us, <hi>2 Cor. 1.10,11.</hi> Again, Croſſes are the files and
whetſtones that ſet an edge on our devotions, without which they grow dull,
and ineffectual: <hi>Jonah</hi> ſleeps in the ſhip, but prays hard in the
Whales belly: Prayer is the wing of the Soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it flyes to Heaven, as
meditation is the Eye wherewith we ſee God, but our Hearts are like
flint-ſtones which muſt be ſmitten e're they will ſend forth theſe
ſparks of Devotion: Chriſt never heard of the <hi>Canaanitiſh</hi> Woman
until her daughter was miſerably vexed with a Devil, but then ſhe comes to
him and <pb facs="tcp:151210:117"/> doth not ſpeak but cry, need and deſire have
raiſed her voice to an importunate Clamour. The God of Mercy is light of
hearing, yet he loves a loud and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſolicitation, not to make
himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to grant, but to make us Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive
Bleſſings, and indeed the very purpoſe of affliction is to make us
Importunate. He that hears the ſecret murmures of our grief, yet will not
ſéem to hear us till our crys be loud and ſtrong: as
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> would not plead for his Clyent till he cryed to him, but
then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered his ſorrow, now I féel thy cauſe. The child have

fall from careleſſe lips, if we would prevail with God we muſt wraſtle,
&amp; if we would wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle happily with God, we muſt Wraſtle firſt with
our own dullneſſe, yea if we felt our wants or wanted not deſire, we

Heaven: affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſoul is as plummets to a clock, and wind to a

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Our ſufferings we an us
from the love of the world, yea make us loath and contemn it, and
contrariwiſe fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Heaven, with a deſire to be diſſolved: St.
<hi>Peter</hi> at Chriſts Tranfiguration en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying but a glimpſe of
happineſſe, he was ſo raviſhed and tranſported with the love of his
preſent eſtate that he breaks out into theſe words: It is good for us to
be here, he would fain have made it his dwelling place, and being loath to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, Chriſt muſt make 3 Tabernacles, <hi>Mat. 17.4.</hi> The love of
this world ſo makes us forget the world to come, that like the
<hi>Iſraelites,</hi> we deſire rather to live in the troubles of
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> then in the Land of Promiſe: whereas S. <hi>Paul</hi> having
ſpoken of his Bonds in Chriſt, and of the ſpiritual Combate, concludeth:
I deſire to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved and to be with Chriſt which is beſt of all,
<hi>Phil. 1.22,23.</hi> Yea it tranſported him to heaven before he came
thither, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> was not where ſhe was but where her deſire was,
and that was with Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity makes us drunk with the love of the
world, like the <hi>Gadarrens</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their ſwine before their
Souls, or him in the Parable that would go to ſee <pb facs="tcp:151210:118"/> his Farm and
looſe Heaven, &amp; thouſands more, who if they have but ſomething to
leave behind them, 'tis no matter whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have any thing to carry with
them. But as ſleep compoſeth drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo the Croſſe will
bring a Man to himſelf again, for when the ſtaff we nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh to bear us
becomes a Cudgel to beat us, when we find the world to ſerve us as the
<hi>Jews</hi> did Chriſt, carry us up to the top of a Hill and then ſtrive
to throw us down headlong, <hi>Luke 4.29.</hi> When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind is ſo inveſted
with cares, moleſted with grief, vexed with pain that which way ſo ever we
caſt our Eyes we find cauſe of Complaint, we more loathed the World than
ever we lov'd it, when no man would harbour y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> unthrift ſon in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel,
he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back again to his Father, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver before: when Satan is let
looſe upon us to ſhew us our ſins, and the danger we are in, then farewel
profit, farewel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, treaſure and all, rather then I will endure
ſuch a rack, ſuch a hell in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whereas if we ſhould onely
hear of Miſery, or read what is threatned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Word, though it might a
little fright us, it would never amend us. A delicious life <pb facs="tcp:151210:119"/> when
every thing about us is reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and contentful makes us that we have no
deſire to go to heaven, wherefore as a loving mother when ſhe would wean
her Child from the Dugg, makes it bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Worm-wood or Aloes, ſo deales
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord with us, he maketh this life bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto us by ſuffering our
enemies to perſecute and oppreſſe us, to the end we may contemn the
world, and tranſport our hopes from earth to heaven, he makes us weep in this

adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they teach us the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, for the leſſe
comfort we find on earth the more we ſeek above, and the more we eſteem the
beſt things: and we are very ungrateful if we do not thank God for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
ſo overcomes us, as that it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the love of the world in us. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
féeds Pride nor kéeps off repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſo much as proſperous
advantage. 'Tis a wonder to ſee a favourite ſtudy for ought but addition to

afflicted and aſſailed, to the end they may be always prepared for

ſo when the Goſpel and outward proſperity go together it is hard to judge
which is moſt reſpected. We all <pb facs="tcp:151210:122"/> call our ſelves
Chriſtians. Why it is an honourable thing to be ſo accounted, but who are
ſuch is known onely where the power of Godlineſſe is in contempt. Oh how

one dram of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mans love is worth a world of Inconſtant formality, but the
friend is falſe hearted, who obſerves me onely for his own ends, affliction
trieth whether a man hath grace in his heart or no, ſet an empty Pitcher (the

waters wher our <hi>Gideon</hi> will try whether we are fit Souldiers to fight
the Battel of faith. A faithful wife ſaid <hi>Bradford</hi> is never try'd
ſo to be until ſhe be aſſaulted, nor a faithful Chriſtian ſo
approved till proved by affliction. None but a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heart can chuſe
rather to ſuffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction with the People of God, rather then to enjoy the
pleaſures of Sin for a <pb facs="tcp:151210:122"/> ſeaſon. A litle intreaty will
ſerve to move Nature to be good to it ſelf: but to perſiſt, in actions
of goodneſſe, though Tiranny torment death and hell ſtood in our way,
this is that which ſhall be Crown'd with Glory: finally; affliction and
perſecution is both a whetſtone and touchſtone to each particular Grace,
it humbles the ſpirits of the repentant, trieth the faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of
the ſincere Chriſtian, but harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hearts of the ungodly, for wicked
men grow worſe after affliction as water grows cold after any heat, yea like

y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> did much forget God, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole life of <hi>David</hi>

&amp; indeed if God did not often viſit us we ſhould ſerve him as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
women of <hi>Tartary</hi> do their husbands, who Marry if they be abſent but
Twenty days: but the fire of correction eats out the ruſt of corruption, many
are able to ſay they have learned to ſtand by falling, got ſtrength by
weakneſs, burnt child dreads the fire, &amp; a broken bone well ſet is
faſter ever after, like Trées we take déeper root by ſhaking,
and like Torches we flame the Brighter for bruſting and knocking, God
ſuffered Satan to ſpoil <hi>Job</hi> of his ſubſtance, rob him of his
Children, puniſh him in the body; yet mark but the ſequel well and you
ſhall find that he was croſt with a bleſſing, as the Phyſitian in
making of Treacle or Mithridate for his patient, uſeth ſerpents adders and
ſuch like poyſon, that he may drive out one poyſon with another, even
ſo our ſpiritual Phyſitian is pleaſ'd to uſe the <pb facs="tcp:151210:124"/>
Malice of Satan and wicked men, when he tempereth us the Cup of affliction,
that hereby he may expel one evil with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yea two evils with one:
namely, the evil of ſin, and the evil of puniſhment, and that both Temporal
and Eternal, God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers us to be afflicted becauſe he will not ſuffer
us to be damn'd, ſuch is the goodneſſe of our heavenly Father to us, that
even his anger proceeds from Mercy, he ſcourgeth the fleſh that the
ſpirit may be ſaved in the day of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>1 Cor. 5.5.</hi>
Yea <hi>Joſeph</hi> was therefore abaſed in the Dungeon that his
advancement might be the greater. It is true in our thoughts, we often ſpeak
for the fleſh, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did for <hi>Iſhmael: Oh!</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     <hi>Iſhmael <hi>might live in thy ſight:</hi>
                     </hi> No, God takes away
<hi>Iſhmael</hi> and gives <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he withdraws the pleaſure of
the fleſh, &amp; gives delight to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Soul, croſſing us in our wills,
that he may advance our Benifit. A Man is ſick of Pleuriſte, the
Phyſitian lets him Blood, he is content with it, the arm ſhall ſmart to
eaſe the heart. The Covetous man hath a Pleuriſte of Riches, God lets him
blood by poverty, let him be patient, it is a courſe to ſave his ſoul.

<hi>Iſa. 45.9.</hi> Nor is it méerly for his own glory, without any

the reaſons both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp; after ſhew, wherefore let us be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted in
the words of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> to rejoyce in ſuffering, foraſmuch as we
with all the ſaints are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, that when his
Glory ſhall appear we may be glad and rejoyce, <hi>1 Pet. 4.13.</hi> And what
greater promotion can fleſh &amp; blood be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, than a conformity to
the Lord of glory. Chriſt wore a Crown of Thorns for me, &amp; ſhal I
grudge to wear this paper cap for him, ſaid <hi>John Huſs,</hi> when they
put a cap upon him that had ugly devils painted on it, with the title of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Afflictions ſerve to encreaſe our faith
for the time to come, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how the Lord hath delivered us
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: as when <hi>Saul</hi> tells <hi>David</hi> thou art not able to go
againſt this great <hi>Philiſtine</hi> to fight with him, for thou art a
Boy, &amp; he a <pb facs="tcp:151210:129"/> man of War from his youth, what ſaith
<hi>David?</hi> thy ſervant kept his fathers Shéep &amp; there came a
Lyon, &amp; likewiſe a Bear, &amp; took a Sheep out of the flock, &amp; I
went out after him &amp; ſmote him, &amp; took it out of his mouth, &amp;
when he roſe againſt me I caught him by the Beard, &amp; ſmote him &amp;
ſlew him; ſo thy ſervant ſlew both the Lyon and the Bear. Therefore
(mark the Inferrence) this uncircumciſed <hi>Philiſtine</hi> ſhall be as
one of them, yea (ſaith he) the Lord that delivered me out of the paw of the
Lyon, &amp; out of the paw of the Bear, he wil deliver me out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of
this <hi>Philiſtine, 1 Sam. 17.33,</hi> to <hi>37.</hi> Obſerve how
confidently he ſpeaks: God hath delivered me ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> out of the
mouth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lyon (meaning <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>) &amp; he will deliver me from every
Evil Work, &amp; will preſerve me unto his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdome, <hi>2 Tim.

yea, ſuch he acounts his Champions &amp; worthies, whence it is many are
trained up in trouble all their days, as it fared with <hi>David,</hi> for as a
Bear came to <hi>David</hi> after a Lyon, &amp; a Gyant after a Bear, &amp; a
King after a Gyant, &amp; <hi>Philiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines</hi> after a King, &amp; all to
make him more hardy and confident in his God: ſo when they that are intended
for Chriſts Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, have fought with the Devil &amp; their own Luſts,
they ſhall fight with Envy, when they have fought with Envy, they ſhall
fight with Poverty, when they have fought with Poverty they ſhall fight with
Infamy, when they have fought with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy, they ſhall fight with
ſickneſſe, when they have fought with ſickneſſe, they ſhall fight
with death like a Labourer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is never out of Work, &amp; this not onely
proves but mightily improves their faith: &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed till we have been
delivered out of a leſſe trouble, we cannot truſt God in a greater. As
the Prophet could ſay: <hi>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee,</hi>
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly follows (and not till then) <hi>the Lord heard me,</hi> the Lord
ſaw him ſinking all the while, but lets him alone till he was at the

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:151210:131"/>In the <hi>Elevrnth</hi> place: Our manifold
ſufferings, and Gods often delivering us, doth increaſe our joy &amp;
thankfulneſſe, yea, make after bleſſings more ſwéet, by this
we have new ſongs put into our Mouths, &amp; new occaſions offered to
praiſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of our deliverance, when the Lord brought again the
Captivity of <hi>Sion</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> in the perſon of
<hi>Iſrael</hi>) <hi>we were like them that dream</hi>) (meaning the
Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſéemed too good to be true) then were our Mouths fil'd
with laughter (ſaith he) and our tongues with joy, the Lord hath done great
things for us, whereof we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, <hi>Pſal. 136.1,2,3,4.</hi> Is any one
afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I will ſay to him as that harbinger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered a Noble man,
complaining that he was lodged in ſo homely a Room, you will take pleaſure
in it when we are out of it, for the more grievous our exigent, the more
glorious our advancement. A deſire accompliſhed delighteth the ſoul,
<hi>Prov. 13.19.</hi> We read how that lamentable &amp; ſad decree of
<hi>Ahaſhuerus</hi> through the goodneſs of God was an occaſion
excéedingly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the <hi>Jews</hi> joy &amp; thankfulneſs,
inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that as the Text ſaith: The days that were appointed for their
death &amp; ruine were turned into days of feaſting and joy, <pb facs="tcp:151210:131"/>
and wherein they ſent preſents every man to his neighbour, &amp; gifts to
the poor, <hi>Eſth. 9.17,</hi> to <hi>28.</hi> And this joy &amp;
thankfulneſſe was ſo laſting y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> ceaſe not to
celebrate the ſame unto this day: Gods dealing with us is often harſh in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> begining, hard in the procéeding, but the Concluſion is always
comfortable; the joy of <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; the reſt of the Church was
greater after he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of priſon by the Angel, <hi>Acts 12.</hi>
And the joy of <hi>Judith</hi> &amp; the reſt of <hi>Bethalia</hi> when ſhe
returned with <hi>Holoferneſs</hi> head, then if they had never béen
in diſtreſſe, <hi>Judith 13.</hi> The Lord deprives us of good things for
a time becauſe they never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in their full Beauty till they turn their
backs &amp; be going away: Again he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his aid on purpoſe to encreaſe
our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires before it comes, &amp; our joy &amp; thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs when it is
come to inflame our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, for things eaſily come by are little ſet by
to encreaſe our joy for that which hath béen long detained, is at
laſt more ſwéetly obtained, what (think we) did he that was born
blind think when his eyes were firſt given him, how did he wonder at heaven
and earth, the ſtrange and goodly varieties of all the Creatures, &amp;
chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the light, every thing did not more <pb facs="tcp:151210:132"/>
pleaſe then aſtoniſh him, as Mothers love their Children more tenderly
then Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe they ſtood them in more, ſo we prize the comforts
and joys of Gods favour more by having for a ſeaſon béen deprived of
them through afflictions &amp; deſcretions. The benefit that comes ſoon
&amp; with eaſe is eaſily contemned long &amp; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger purſuit endears any
favour. The wiſe men rejoyced excéedingly to find the ſtar, the
woman to find her piece of ſilver, the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to find the Lord
Ieſus, who always returneth with increaſe of joy. He may abſent himſelf
for a time, but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it only as a preparation to make us reliſh that
ſwéet food, the better he may kéep us faſting, but it is on
purpoſe that our tryal may be perfect, our deliverance welcome, our
Repentance glorious, we never know the worth of a Benefit ſo well as by the
want of it, want teacheth us the worth of things moſt truly. Oh! how
ſwéet a thing is peace to them that have béen long troubled
with wars and tedious contentions: how ſwéet is liberty to one that
hath béen long immured within a caſe of Walls? How dear a jewel is
health to him that tumbles in diſtempered blood for then onely we begin to
prize it when we have loſt it: Let a man but faſt a Meal <pb facs="tcp:151210:132"/> or
two, O how ſwéet is brown bread, though it would not down before, we
are never ſo glad of our friends company, as when he returns after long
abſence, or a Tedious Voyage. The Nights darkneſs makes the light of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Sun more deſirable, &amp; a Calm is beſt welcome after a tempeſt. And
thus we ſée that good things then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of moſt worth, when they
are known in their wants. And as when we would have ſome fires flame, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
more we ſprinkle water upon them. Even ſo when the Lord will encreaſe our
joy &amp; thankfulneſs he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeth it with the tears of affliction, miſery
ſwéetneth joy, yea the ſorrows of this life ſhall like a dark veil
give a luſtre to the glory of the next, when the Lord ſhall turn this water
of our earthly affliction into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wine of gladneſs, wherewith our ſouls
ſhal be ſatiate for ever, well then art thou vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, perſecuted, &amp;
afflicted by ſome cruel and malitious <hi>Saul,</hi> &amp; is it grievous to
thée for the preſent, why that which hath béen hard to ſuffer
is ſweet to remember, at laſt our ſongs ſhall be louder then our
cries.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Twelfth</hi> place: Our ſufferings make us
teachable, &amp; increaſe in us ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual wiſdome, <hi>Job 36.15.</hi>
He delivereth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poor in time of affliction, &amp; openeth their ear in

the féet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and what ſaith <hi>Neoman</hi> upon the

Leproſte, &amp; his miſpriſſon of God: the prodigal ſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not
his fathers admonition ſo long as he enjoyed proſperity, when we ſmart
not we believe not, and God is not feared till felt, but that which makes the
Body ſmart makes the Soul wiſe, even to looſe is ſome ways profitable,
it makes a Man wary. <hi>Algerius</hi> the Martyr could ſay by experience he
found more light in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon then without in all the world: The
<hi>Scottiſh</hi> King Priſoner in <hi>Mortimers</hi> hole learnt more of
Chriſt then in his Pallace. <hi>Luther</hi> betwéen a divine in

with fire, are made plyable &amp; apt to receive impreſſion from the
workman, even ſo when we are ſoaked in the floods of ſorrow &amp;
ſoftned in the fire of affliction, we are apteſt to receive the
impreſſion of Gods law into our hearts, when he ſpeaks to us by his
Miniſters: If y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord breaks us in pieces with the plow of his Iuſtice,
then let the ſéeds men his Miniſters ſow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſéed of his

affliction by a divine and ſupream providence doth make ſo much for our
advantage and benefit here and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, as namely that it opens our eyes, no
leſs than peace and proſperity had formerly ſhut them, that nothing doth
ſo powerfully call home the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that we need no other memory
for ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Miſery, if commonly we are at Varience with God, Men
were at peace with our enemies and that it is both hard and happy, not to be
the worſe with Liberty. If God the alwiſe Phyſitian knows this the
fitteſt Medicine for our Souls ſickneſs, and that we cannot otherwiſe
be cured, if Pride cauſeth God to let us fall by temptation, that we may
ſee our own frailty and weakneſſe, and grow more Humble, if Affliction
will above all things make us pray to God with heat and fervency, if true and
Saving Joy be onely the Daughter of ſorrow, if it weans us from the love of
earthly things, if it diſcovers unto us the truth of our Graces, and prevents
greater evils of ſin and puniſhment to come, if it makes us humble and
conformable to Chriſt our Head, if it increaſeth our ſaith, our joy and
thankfulneſs, our ſpiritual wiſdom and patience, if by ſmarting in our
Bodies States or Names, we are ſaved from ſmarting in our Souls: Then as
Solomon adviſeth: Refuſe not the Chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Lord, neither be
grieved with his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, Pro. 3.11. But let us all willingly ſubmit to
Gods afflicting hand, and ſuffer chearfully what is laid upon us, admiring at
the infinite wiſdome, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and goodneſs of our gracious God, who turns
all our Poyſons into Cordials, who doth change our terrours into pleaſures,
and makes the greateſt Evils Beneficial unto us. Conſider what hath been
